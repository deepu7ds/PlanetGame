1
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:16,456
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

2
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,547
It's just water.

3
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,717
It's a lot of water.

4
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,052
A lot of ...

5
00:01:33,307 --> 00:01:34,682
Come on.

6
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:01,876
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just ...

7
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:05,755
I just can't ... 
Can't stomach the water.

8
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,928
- You're my new partner.
- That's right.

9
00:02:13,013 --> 00:02:16,015
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

10
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,144
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

11
00:02:19,228 --> 00:02:21,688
- I'll give you that.
- The legend?

12
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:24,440
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

13
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,902
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

14
00:02:30,614 --> 00:02:32,782
How long you been with the Marshals?

15
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:34,284
Four years.

16
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,204
So you know how small it is.

17
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:39,706
Sure.

18
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:43,710
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

19
00:02:44,545 --> 00:02:45,795
I was.

20
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:59,267
She died.

21
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:03,229
- Jesus. I don't ...
- Don't worry about it.

22
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:07,859
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

23
00:03:07,943 --> 00:03:09,652
Four people died.

24
00:03:09,737 --> 00:03:13,573
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

25
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:15,366
I'm sorry, boss.

26
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:18,244
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

27
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,413
Oh, here, have one of mine.

28
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:24,000
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

29
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:26,794
Government employees
will rob you blind.

30
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,465
Thanks.

31
00:03:31,508 --> 00:03:34,260
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

32
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:37,013
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

33
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:39,432
For the criminally insane.

34
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:43,144
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices ...

35
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:46,689
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

36
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:58,701
- Is that where we're headed?
- Yep.

37
00:03:59,203 --> 00:04:01,579
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs ...

38
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:04,207
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

39
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,752
The dock, 
it's the only way on or off.

40
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:11,798
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

41
00:04:11,882 --> 00:04:14,509
I'd appreciate it 
if you'd hurry up about it.

42
00:04:14,593 --> 00:04:17,345
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

43
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:46,374
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

44
00:04:48,043 --> 00:04:49,919
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

45
00:04:50,004 --> 00:04:51,170
Welcome to Shutter Island.

46
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:54,299
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

47
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:09,480
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

48
00:05:09,565 --> 00:05:11,941
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

49
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,237
Electrified perimeter.

50
00:06:00,074 --> 00:06:01,824
How can you tell?

51
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:04,744
I've seen something like it before.

52
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:37,193
All right. You gentlemen will be 
accorded all the help we can give,

53
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:40,238
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

54
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:41,697
Is that understood?

55
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:43,157
Absolutely.

56
00:06:43,617 --> 00:06:46,953
The red brick building on your 
right is Ward A, the male ward.

57
00:06:47,037 --> 00:06:50,415
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

58
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:53,459
Ward C is that building 
on the bluffs.

59
00:06:53,544 --> 00:06:55,128
An old Civil War fort.

60
00:06:55,212 --> 00:06:57,630
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

61
00:06:57,714 --> 00:06:59,632
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden ...

62
00:06:59,716 --> 00:07:02,385
without the written consent
and physical presence ...

63
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,012
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

64
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:06,889
Is that understood?

65
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,268
You act like insanity is catching.

66
00:07:13,147 --> 00:07:16,399
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

67
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:21,279
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

68
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:23,865
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

69
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:26,951
Executive order 319 of the 
Federal Code of Penitentiaries ...

70
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:29,078
states that when inside a penitentiary,

71
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:32,582
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

72
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,464
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

73
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:02,195
Okay. Now that the official 
stuff's done, come on, boys,

74
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,238
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

75
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,961
When did she escape? This prisoner?

76
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:23,216
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have to 
fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

77
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,426
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

78
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:27,678
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

79
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:31,182
It's the only facility of its 
kind in the U.S., even the world.

80
00:08:31,266 --> 00:08:33,809
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

81
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:35,853
ones no other hospital can manage.

82
00:08:35,938 --> 00:08:37,855
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

83
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,857
He's created something
really unique here.

84
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:43,528
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

85
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:10,096
Top of his class
at Johns Hopkins, then Harvard ...

86
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:13,266
IDs, gentlemen.

87
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,896
Show your badges, gentlemen.

88
00:09:18,981 --> 00:09:22,942
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

89
00:09:23,026 --> 00:09:25,486
- MI5, the OSS ...
- Why?

90
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,197
What do you mean?

91
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:32,785
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

92
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:35,162
I guess you'll have to ask him.

93
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:47,049
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

94
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:49,093
Marshal Aule.

95
00:09:49,553 --> 00:09:52,263
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

96
00:09:52,347 --> 00:09:55,016
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

97
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:58,352
He had a lot to say about you.

98
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:01,647
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

99
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:04,025
And what would that be, exactly?

100
00:10:04,109 --> 00:10:07,778
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

101
00:10:07,863 --> 00:10:10,865
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

102
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,875
Those paintings are quite accurate.

103
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,835
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here ...

104
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,130
were shackled and left 
in their own filth.

105
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,506
They were beaten,

106
00:10:27,591 --> 00:10:29,842
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

107
00:10:29,926 --> 00:10:32,011
We drove screws into their brains,

108
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:35,931
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness ...

109
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,476
or even drowned.

110
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,519
- And now?
- We treat them.

111
00:10:40,604 --> 00:10:42,813
Try to heal, try to cure.

112
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:44,523
And if that fails,
at least we provide them ...

113
00:10:44,608 --> 00:10:47,860
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

114
00:10:47,944 --> 00:10:51,197
These are all violent offenders, right?

115
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,532
I mean, they've hurt people.

116
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:58,037
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases, yes.

117
00:10:58,121 --> 00:10:59,955
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

118
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,416
screw their sense of calm.

119
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:07,755
It's my job to treat my patients, not 
their victims. I'm not here to judge.

120
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,466
- So this female prisoner ...
- Patient.

121
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:13,219
Excuse me. Patient,

122
00:11:13,303 --> 00:11:18,391
one Rachel Solando,
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

123
00:11:18,475 --> 00:11:22,395
- Last night between 10:00 and midnight.
- Is she considered dangerous?

124
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:26,107
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

125
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:29,902
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

126
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:33,280
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

127
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:36,242
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

128
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:39,662
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

129
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:42,748
And what about the husband?

130
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:46,544
He died on the beaches of Normandy.
She's a war widow.

131
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,588
She starved herself
when she first came here.

132
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:52,508
She insisted the children weren't dead.

133
00:12:02,352 --> 00:12:05,104
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

134
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:07,940
- Prone to headaches, Marshal?
- Sometimes. But today,

135
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:11,986
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, dehydration.

136
00:12:12,237 --> 00:12:13,863
- You all right, boss?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:16,657
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

138
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:18,284
Thanks so much.

139
00:12:19,161 --> 00:12:22,163
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

140
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:25,708
She also believes this place 
is her home in the Berkshires.

141
00:12:27,753 --> 00:12:30,087
- You're kidding me.
- She's never once in two years ...

142
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:31,839
acknowledged that she's
in an institution.

143
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:35,801
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

144
00:12:35,886 --> 00:12:38,095
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

145
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,181
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

146
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:43,642
and she gives us all
parts to play in that fiction.

147
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:46,645
So have you searched the grounds yet?

148
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,315
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

149
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:50,900
Not a trace.

150
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:56,030
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

151
00:12:56,114 --> 00:12:59,909
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

152
00:13:02,746 --> 00:13:06,207
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

153
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:15,925
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

154
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:19,011
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

155
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:30,022
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

156
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:33,025
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

157
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:35,110
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

158
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:37,363
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

159
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:38,823
Two pairs.

160
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:43,160
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

161
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:47,122
So, she left here barefoot?

162
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,543
Come on, Doc, she couldn't 
get 10 yards in that terrain.

163
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,212
Marshal?

164
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,233
This is definitely 
Rachel's handwriting.

165
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:17,152
I have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

166
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:20,072
- It's not a psychiatric term?
- I'm afraid not.

167
00:14:20,156 --> 00:14:21,657
"Who is 67?"

168
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:23,993
Fuck if I know.

169
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,121
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

170
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:29,915
Think it's just random scribblings?

171
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,752
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

172
00:14:33,837 --> 00:14:35,254
This paper could be important.

173
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:38,215
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

174
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,675
Of course.

175
00:14:41,595 --> 00:14:44,471
And you say
she had to come through here?

176
00:14:44,556 --> 00:14:48,809
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

177
00:14:48,894 --> 00:14:52,229
Last night, there were seven men
sitting at the base of those stairs ...

178
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:53,772
playing stud poker.

179
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:56,901
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

180
00:14:57,611 --> 00:14:58,611
Why?

181
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:01,322
How? She turns invisible?

182
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:04,283
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files ...

183
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:05,409
of all the medical staff.

184
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:08,287
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

185
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:10,497
We'll take your request
under consideration.

186
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:13,876
This is not a request, Doctor.

187
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,462
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner ...

188
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:18,756
- Patient.
patient ...

189
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,133
has escaped. Now, you will comply or ...

190
00:15:21,217 --> 00:15:23,552
All I can say is 
I'll see what I can do.

191
00:15:23,637 --> 00:15:28,599
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak
with the staff. Do you understand?

192
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:30,893
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

193
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,270
If you have any further questions,

194
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:36,649
feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.

195
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,621
It's 11 miles
to the nearest land ...

196
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:52,414
and the water's freezing.

197
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:55,542
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

198
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:57,211
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

199
00:15:57,295 --> 00:16:00,464
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

200
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:06,679
What about those caves
down there? Have you checked them?

201
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:09,139
No way she could get there.

202
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:12,017
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

203
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:16,146
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

204
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,109
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

205
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:28,117
All right, let's check the other side.

206
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:36,458
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

207
00:16:37,127 --> 00:16:39,920
The guards already searched inside it.

208
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,049
What's in there? More patients?

209
00:16:44,134 --> 00:16:46,260
Sewage treatment facility.

210
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,639
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

211
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:52,266
Let's go, boys!

212
00:16:56,146 --> 00:16:58,063
You were on watch
on the landing, huh?

213
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:01,567
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor ...

214
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:03,402
without me seeing.

215
00:17:03,486 --> 00:17:08,198
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does 
she have to pass to get down here?

216
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:17,082
Me. Glen Miga.

217
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,918
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

218
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,337
And you were at your post all night?

219
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:24,757
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

220
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,968
Glen.

221
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:30,804
Glen.

222
00:17:33,641 --> 00:17:35,392
Tell me the truth.

223
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,811
I ...

224
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:42,107
I maybe went to the bathroom.

225
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:45,277
What? You breached protocol. 
Christ ...

226
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:47,696
I wasn't gone more than a minute.

227
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:50,783
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

228
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:54,286
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

229
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,790
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

230
00:17:57,874 --> 00:17:59,583
Anyone?

231
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,126
Come on, anyone, anyone,

232
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:02,377
anyone, anyone.

233
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:05,464
She was in a group therapy session.

234
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:08,383
Huh. Anything unusual occur?

235
00:18:09,552 --> 00:18:11,261
Define "unusual."

236
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:12,805
Excuse me?

237
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:17,267
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

238
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:19,311
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

239
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:22,981
I will rephrase.

240
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,985
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

241
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,571
let's say, I don't know,
memorable than ...

242
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,406
- Normal?
- Exactly.

243
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,867
No. Sorry.

244
00:18:34,244 --> 00:18:37,538
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

245
00:18:38,414 --> 00:18:40,707
She was worried about the rain.

246
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:43,043
And she hated the food here.

247
00:18:43,294 --> 00:18:45,254
Complained constantly,

248
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,089
last night included.

249
00:18:48,466 --> 00:18:51,593
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

250
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:55,013
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

251
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,474
Dr. Sheehan?

252
00:18:58,184 --> 00:19:00,519
Yes, he was running the session.

253
00:19:01,938 --> 00:19:05,816
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

254
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:06,942
Huh.

255
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:10,863
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

256
00:19:10,947 --> 00:19:15,450
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

257
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,871
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

258
00:19:18,955 --> 00:19:23,709
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

259
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:27,963
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

260
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:30,299
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

261
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:38,390
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

262
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:41,226
Hello? Hello?

263
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:45,981
Hello? Anybody there?

264
00:19:47,275 --> 00:19:49,359
I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

265
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:51,320
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

266
00:19:51,404 --> 00:19:53,363
If you get it working,
come find me immediately.

267
00:19:53,448 --> 00:19:55,908
The marshals need to make
an important call.

268
00:19:55,992 --> 00:19:57,326
Yes, sir.

269
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:03,373
Hello? Hello?

270
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,542
I'm afraid I have
evening rounds in the wards,

271
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:09,379
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

272
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:11,465
if you'd care to drop by.

273
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,842
Good. We can talk then, right?

274
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:18,305
We have been talking, Marshal.

275
00:20:34,864 --> 00:20:38,075
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got 
in the wrong line of public service.

276
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,620
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the Civil War,

277
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:44,957
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

278
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:54,299
This is the original
commander's quarters.

279
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:57,970
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

280
00:20:58,054 --> 00:21:00,097
I can see why.

281
00:21:00,181 --> 00:21:02,724
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

282
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:04,685
No.

283
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:16,238
- It's Mahler.
- Quite right, Marshal.

284
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,951
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

285
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:32,546
Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.

286
00:21:36,092 --> 00:21:37,676
Your poison, gentlemen?

287
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,595
- Rye, if you got it.
- Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

288
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,434
Oh? You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

289
00:21:47,103 --> 00:21:50,439
Isn't it common
for men in your profession to imbibe?

290
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,775
Common enough. And yours?

291
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,570
I'm sorry?

292
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:59,531
- Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
- Yes.

293
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:01,950
I always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

294
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,954
Not that I've noticed.

295
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,874
What's that?
Iced tea in your glass, there?

296
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:14,671
Excellent, Marshal. You have
outstanding defense mechanisms.

297
00:22:15,631 --> 00:22:19,551
You must be quite adept
at interrogations, hmm?

298
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:31,021
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

299
00:22:31,689 --> 00:22:33,398
Men of violence.

300
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,359
Now that's a hell 
of an assumption to make.

301
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:38,111
No assumption. No, not at all.
You misunderstand me.

302
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:41,198
I said you are men of violence.

303
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:44,409
I'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

304
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:45,494
That's quite different.

305
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,413
No, please. Please. 
Edify us, Doctor.

306
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,085
You both served overseas, huh?

307
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:54,419
It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

308
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:58,006
For all you know, we were 
both paper pushers over there.

309
00:22:58,091 --> 00:22:59,549
No, you were not.

310
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,650
Since the schoolyard,

311
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:20,779
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

312
00:23:20,863 --> 00:23:23,031
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

313
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:26,993
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

314
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:28,912
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

315
00:23:28,996 --> 00:23:32,416
Ah! Yes. "Raised."

316
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:36,545
And who raised you, Marshal?

317
00:23:37,046 --> 00:23:38,213
Me?

318
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:41,049
- Wolves.
- Ah!

319
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:46,555
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

320
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,741
Do you believe
in God, Marshal?

321
00:24:53,998 --> 00:24:55,874
No, I'm quite serious.

322
00:25:01,797 --> 00:25:04,466
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

323
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:10,805
Huh?

324
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:21,858
His English really is very good.

325
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:24,778
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

326
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:27,531
You're a German?

327
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:30,742
Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

328
00:25:30,826 --> 00:25:33,245
Oh, I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

329
00:25:35,498 --> 00:25:38,750
Now, listen. We're gonna need
those files on Sheehan ...

330
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:40,627
and the rest of the staff as well.

331
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:43,838
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

332
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:47,008
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

333
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,761
Bullshit, out of the question! Bullshit!

334
00:25:49,845 --> 00:25:52,639
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway, huh?

335
00:25:52,723 --> 00:25:56,268
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

336
00:25:56,352 --> 00:25:58,520
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

337
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,940
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

338
00:26:02,024 --> 00:26:05,735
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

339
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,404
This investigation is over.

340
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,781
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to ...

341
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:12,367
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys. That's right.

342
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:16,204
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

343
00:26:24,797 --> 00:26:26,214
Nice night.

344
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:35,223
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

345
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:51,072
Hey, boss. We really packing it in?

346
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:52,866
Why?

347
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,704
I guess ... I don't know, I just 
never really quit anything before.

348
00:26:58,122 --> 00:27:00,957
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

349
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:05,295
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

350
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:06,588
without any help.

351
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:09,674
I think she had a lot of help.

352
00:27:10,384 --> 00:27:12,969
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now ...

353
00:27:13,054 --> 00:27:15,347
rethinking his whole attitude.

354
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:19,893
- Maybe, in the morning, we'll be ...
- You're bluffing?

355
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:22,145
I didn't say that.

356
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:43,208
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

357
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:46,378
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

358
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:50,131
I killed a lot of people in the war.

359
00:27:51,884 --> 00:27:53,760
Is that why you drink?

360
00:27:56,597 --> 00:27:58,098
Are you real?

361
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:00,308
No.

362
00:28:04,313 --> 00:28:05,980
She's still here.

363
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:07,982
Who?

364
00:28:09,068 --> 00:28:10,318
Rachel?

365
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:13,196
She never left.

366
00:28:27,002 --> 00:28:30,714
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

367
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:33,216
We were so happy.

368
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:37,053
She's here.

369
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:39,097
You can't leave.

370
00:28:51,944 --> 00:28:53,778
I'm not gonna leave.

371
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:57,031
I love you so much.

372
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:03,955
I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

373
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,081
No.

374
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:08,042
I am.

375
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:12,839
You have to wake up.

376
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,217
I won't go.

377
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:18,803
You're here.

378
00:29:20,723 --> 00:29:24,601
I'm not. You have to face that.

379
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:29,272
But she is.

380
00:29:31,484 --> 00:29:32,901
So is he.

381
00:29:34,987 --> 00:29:36,196
Who?

382
00:29:38,657 --> 00:29:40,033
Laeddis.

383
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,664
- I have to go.
- No.

384
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,419
No, please. Please.
I need to hold on to you.

385
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:54,756
- Just a little bit longer, please.
- Oh, God, Teddy.

386
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,841
You have to let me go.

387
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,636
I can't.

388
00:30:31,252 --> 00:30:33,419
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

389
00:30:38,634 --> 00:30:39,968
Doctor!

390
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:42,178
Doctor, Doctor.

391
00:30:42,263 --> 00:30:45,265
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

392
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:47,267
I thought your investigation 
was finished.

393
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:50,311
Well, it's not like 
we could take the ferry.

394
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:53,356
Now, was Rachel receiving any 
other treatments for her illnesses?

395
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,570
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

396
00:30:58,654 --> 00:31:00,822
No, not a clue, Doctor.

397
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:02,240
War.

398
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:05,076
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

399
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,661
Psychosurgery.

400
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,706
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

401
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:14,127
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

402
00:31:14,211 --> 00:31:16,504
Others say they become zombies.

403
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:18,756
- And the new school?
- Psychopharmacology.

404
00:31:18,841 --> 00:31:21,092
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

405
00:31:21,176 --> 00:31:24,345
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

406
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,763
And which school are you, Doctor?

407
00:31:25,848 --> 00:31:30,393
Me? I have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

408
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:34,606
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

409
00:31:37,526 --> 00:31:39,903
Come on, Marge. It's okay.

410
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,489
- These patients, huh?
- Even these.

411
00:31:43,574 --> 00:31:45,992
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

412
00:31:46,076 --> 00:31:49,954
Give them a pill, put them in 
a corner, it all goes away.

413
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,290
Rachel Solando was
on a combination of drugs ...

414
00:31:52,374 --> 00:31:54,292
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

415
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:57,462
but it was only 
intermittently effective.

416
00:31:57,546 --> 00:31:59,172
The greatest obstacle 
to her recovery ...

417
00:31:59,256 --> 00:32:02,216
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

418
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,218
"Was."

419
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:09,641
Is there a reason you keep referring
to your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

420
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:15,772
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

421
00:32:22,738 --> 00:32:24,322
Next up is Peter Breene.

422
00:32:24,406 --> 00:32:26,741
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

423
00:32:26,825 --> 00:32:30,370
Nurse survived, but her face 
is permanently disfigured.

424
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:31,913
I can't wait.

425
00:32:31,997 --> 00:32:38,169
She'd smile at me. She was so sweet,
but you could see it in her eyes.

426
00:32:38,253 --> 00:32:41,631
She liked to be naked, to suck cock.

427
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,759
Okay, Mr. Breene.

428
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:48,805
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

429
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:52,058
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

430
00:32:53,018 --> 00:32:56,104
- Well, why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

431
00:32:56,188 --> 00:33:00,400
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

432
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:03,945
Mr. Breene.

433
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,116
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

434
00:33:10,285 --> 00:33:12,537
When I cut her, she screamed.

435
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:17,166
But  ... she scared me.

436
00:33:18,293 --> 00:33:21,462
- What did she expect?
- Interesting.

437
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:26,092
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

438
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:28,219
Rachel Solando. Do you ...

439
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:30,555
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

440
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:32,765
She drowned her kids!

441
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,893
This is ... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

442
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:37,729
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

443
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:42,066
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

444
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:44,777
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

445
00:33:48,157 --> 00:33:49,991
Could you stop that?

446
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:53,911
- That nurse ...
- Please, stop that.

447
00:33:53,996 --> 00:33:57,081
That nurse, 
maybe she had kids, huh?

448
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,418
A husband.

449
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:03,880
Just trying to make ends meet,

450
00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:07,550
lead a normal life.

451
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:10,803
It says in your file that ...

452
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:14,348
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

453
00:34:15,851 --> 00:34:16,809
Congratulations.

454
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:19,812
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

455
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:24,275
Do you know what she was afraid of?

456
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:28,112
You.

457
00:34:28,197 --> 00:34:30,448
Could you stop that? Please?

458
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:33,826
Stop that!

459
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:36,120
Please! Stop!

460
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:38,372
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

461
00:34:38,457 --> 00:34:39,665
No! No.

462
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,793
- Boss. What's up?
- Fine.

463
00:34:41,877 --> 00:34:43,878
- I wanna go back. I wanna go.
- Peter!

464
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:47,590
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

465
00:34:47,674 --> 00:34:50,468
- Go back. I wanna go back.
- Come on, Peter.

466
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:51,677
- I don't wanna see him.
- Easy now.

467
00:34:51,762 --> 00:34:54,555
- I don't wanna see him anymore.
- It's okay. It's all right.

468
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:04,398
Oh, I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

469
00:35:06,235 --> 00:35:08,736
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns ...

470
00:35:08,821 --> 00:35:11,572
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Kearns.

471
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:16,160
But you seem quite normal.

472
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:19,455
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

473
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,167
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

474
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:27,964
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

475
00:35:28,757 --> 00:35:29,799
Ah.

476
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:32,677
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you ...

477
00:35:32,761 --> 00:35:37,598
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

478
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:42,103
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

479
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:44,856
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

480
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,028
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

481
00:35:51,113 --> 00:35:55,825
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

482
00:35:55,909 --> 00:36:01,247
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

483
00:36:01,415 --> 00:36:03,916
I hear enough voices already.

484
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,628
What can you tell us about Rachel?

485
00:36:09,214 --> 00:36:10,339
Um ...

486
00:36:10,507 --> 00:36:13,718
Not much. She keeps to herself.

487
00:36:13,802 --> 00:36:17,221
She believed her kids were alive.

488
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:20,349
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

489
00:36:20,434 --> 00:36:25,396
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen ...

490
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,023
Deliverymen.

491
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:30,651
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

492
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:34,322
Yes. He talked about anger.

493
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:40,286
Tell me about him. What's he like?

494
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:43,789
Uh, he's, uh ...

495
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:48,169
Okay. Nice.

496
00:36:49,504 --> 00:36:51,964
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

497
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:58,221
- Did he ever make a pass at you?
- No.

498
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:02,683
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never ...

499
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:05,394
Um ...

500
00:37:06,063 --> 00:37:08,356
Could I have
a glass of water, please?

501
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,857
No problem.

502
00:37:24,706 --> 00:37:27,041
- Thank you, Marshal.
- Sure.

503
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:34,131
I just have one more question
for you, Mrs. Kearns.

504
00:37:37,386 --> 00:37:40,680
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

505
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:44,934
No.

506
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:47,979
Never heard of him.

507
00:37:53,902 --> 00:37:55,069
She was coached.

508
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:58,239
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

509
00:37:58,323 --> 00:38:01,742
like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who's Andrew Laeddis?

510
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:10,668
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

511
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:17,967
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

512
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:19,927
We just met, Chuck.

513
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:23,931
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

514
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:28,436
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

515
00:38:29,855 --> 00:38:32,648
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

516
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:35,609
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

517
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,491
When this case came over the wires,

518
00:38:43,368 --> 00:38:46,370
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

519
00:38:46,788 --> 00:38:47,997
Why?

520
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,959
Andrew Laeddis,

521
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:54,962
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building ...

522
00:38:55,047 --> 00:38:57,214
where my wife and I lived.

523
00:38:58,258 --> 00:38:59,508
Okay.

524
00:39:01,345 --> 00:39:03,387
He was also a firebug.

525
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:08,809
Andrew Laeddis lit the match ...

526
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:14,482
that caused the fire 
that killed my wife.

527
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,158
Let them out!

528
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:30,164
- What happened to Laeddis?
- He got away with it.

529
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:32,666
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

530
00:39:32,751 --> 00:39:35,753
About a year ago, I open up 
the paper and there he is.

531
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:40,341
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

532
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:43,886
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

533
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,098
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

534
00:39:47,182 --> 00:39:48,933
said voices told him to do it.

535
00:39:49,017 --> 00:39:51,644
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

536
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:53,938
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

537
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:57,775
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

538
00:39:57,859 --> 00:40:00,236
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

539
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,612
Or he could be dead.

540
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:04,281
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

541
00:40:04,366 --> 00:40:06,951
Lot of places to hide a body here.

542
00:40:07,744 --> 00:40:10,663
Only one place
no one would really notice.

543
00:40:22,217 --> 00:40:26,303
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

544
00:40:26,388 --> 00:40:29,306
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

545
00:40:29,391 --> 00:40:30,516
No.

546
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:33,727
Come on, boss.

547
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:39,150
She wrote it.

548
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:59,670
Boss! We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

549
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:02,006
- Hold on.
- No, let's go!

550
00:41:04,885 --> 00:41:06,343
Watch out!

551
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:09,680
Jesus!

552
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:13,726
- Come on! Up there!
- Let's go!

553
00:41:16,396 --> 00:41:18,355
Get in there! Let's go!

554
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:23,194
Boss!

555
00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:32,328
- God!
- Jesus Christ!

556
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:35,623
Damn it. God!

557
00:41:44,299 --> 00:41:47,593
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

558
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:56,685
So if Laeddis is here,

559
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,147
what are you gonna do about it?
- Mmm.

560
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,193
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

561
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:14,703
If it was my wife, 
I'd kill him. Twice.

562
00:42:25,465 --> 00:42:30,094
When we got through the gates
at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.

563
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:44,358
The Kommandant tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he ...

564
00:42:45,527 --> 00:42:46,819
He botched it.

565
00:42:48,363 --> 00:42:50,364
Took him an hour to die.

566
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:59,206
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

567
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:05,379
Too many to count.

568
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:33,907
Too many to imagine.

569
00:43:36,536 --> 00:43:38,245
So, yeah, the ...

570
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,333
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

571
00:43:42,417 --> 00:43:44,335
and we lined them up.

572
00:44:28,546 --> 00:44:30,673
It wasn't warfare. It was ...

573
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:34,218
It was murder.

574
00:44:37,722 --> 00:44:40,641
Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

575
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:45,145
That's not why I'm here.

576
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:49,024
So what is this all about?

577
00:44:50,276 --> 00:44:56,156
After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

578
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:00,744
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

579
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:02,329
You know, it's like it ...

580
00:45:02,831 --> 00:45:04,873
It's like they're scared or something.

581
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:09,920
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant ...

582
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:13,674
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

583
00:45:13,758 --> 00:45:16,927
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists ...

584
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:19,346
from an island in Boston Harbor?

585
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:22,599
By conducting experiments on the mind.

586
00:45:24,018 --> 00:45:25,477
At least that's my guess.

587
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:27,271
And you think that's going on here?

588
00:45:27,355 --> 00:45:29,857
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

589
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:32,609
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

590
00:45:32,694 --> 00:45:37,072
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

591
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:39,199
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

592
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:40,659
Guess what they were testing?

593
00:45:40,744 --> 00:45:41,827
Toothpaste.

594
00:45:41,911 --> 00:45:44,288
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

595
00:45:44,372 --> 00:45:49,376
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

596
00:45:50,044 --> 00:45:53,505
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

597
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:58,510
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

598
00:45:59,304 --> 00:46:04,016
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he ...

599
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,562
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

600
00:46:09,189 --> 00:46:11,774
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

601
00:46:12,817 --> 00:46:15,611
- And you found him.
- Yeah, I found him.

602
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:18,197
Well, he's a mess.

603
00:46:19,783 --> 00:46:21,909
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

604
00:46:21,993 --> 00:46:23,118
What?

605
00:46:23,203 --> 00:46:25,245
They're experimenting on people here.

606
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:27,748
I don't know, boss.

607
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:32,294
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

608
00:46:32,378 --> 00:46:36,632
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

609
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:38,884
I stood at Dachau.

610
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:43,806
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

611
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:46,475
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

612
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,438
and now ... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil? No.

613
00:46:52,607 --> 00:46:55,234
So what are you 
really here to do, Ted?

614
00:46:55,944 --> 00:46:59,738
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

615
00:46:59,823 --> 00:47:02,074
and I'm gonna blow 
the lid off this place.

616
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:04,117
That's it.

617
00:47:04,911 --> 00:47:06,411
Wait a minute.

618
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:09,790
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

619
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:11,291
waiting for a chance 
to get out here,

620
00:47:11,376 --> 00:47:13,961
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

621
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:17,923
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

622
00:47:18,007 --> 00:47:21,009
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

623
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:22,761
The world doesn't work that way.

624
00:47:22,846 --> 00:47:26,139
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

625
00:47:26,224 --> 00:47:29,351
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

626
00:47:29,435 --> 00:47:33,105
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

627
00:47:33,189 --> 00:47:37,776
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

628
00:47:37,861 --> 00:47:39,862
- What if they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

629
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:42,072
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

630
00:47:42,156 --> 00:47:43,657
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

631
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:46,618
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

632
00:47:46,703 --> 00:47:47,870
There's no way 
they could've known ...

633
00:47:47,954 --> 00:47:49,329
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

634
00:47:49,414 --> 00:47:52,749
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

635
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:56,044
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

636
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:57,921
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

637
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:04,511
Marshals, are you out here?

638
00:48:04,596 --> 00:48:06,930
This is Deputy Warden McPherson.

639
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,682
Marshals!

640
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:10,767
How about that? They found us, huh?

641
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:13,353
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

642
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:16,356
I know you're in there.

643
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:21,111
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

644
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:27,534
- Come on!
- Go, go!

645
00:48:37,337 --> 00:48:40,464
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

646
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:44,635
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

647
00:48:49,807 --> 00:48:54,144
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

648
00:48:54,228 --> 00:48:57,022
That is, if we all don't 
wash away first.

649
00:48:57,106 --> 00:49:01,568
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

650
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:03,320
So ...

651
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:07,115
This is our only choice, huh?

652
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,243
Got something really nice in a 
prison gray if that don't work for you.

653
00:49:10,328 --> 00:49:13,246
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

654
00:49:13,957 --> 00:49:17,042
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients ...

655
00:49:17,126 --> 00:49:19,378
be placed in manual restraints.

656
00:49:19,462 --> 00:49:22,798
If the facility floods, 
they'll drown. You know that.

657
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:24,508
That would take
a lot of flooding.

658
00:49:24,592 --> 00:49:25,550
We're on an island ...

659
00:49:25,635 --> 00:49:27,260
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane.

660
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:30,013
A lot of flooding seems
like a distinct possibility.

661
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:32,432
It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

662
00:49:32,517 --> 00:49:33,767
There's a backup generator.

663
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:36,561
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

664
00:49:38,106 --> 00:49:40,357
Where are they going to go? Mmm?

665
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:43,443
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

666
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:44,528
Oh, you're quite right.

667
00:49:44,612 --> 00:49:47,781
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

668
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,618
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

669
00:49:51,953 --> 00:49:53,829
This is 24 human beings.

670
00:49:54,455 --> 00:49:55,789
And you can live with that, can you?

671
00:49:55,957 --> 00:49:59,960
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B ...

672
00:50:00,044 --> 00:50:01,378
in manual restraints as well.

673
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:04,339
- Excuse me! Excuse me.
- Marshal.

674
00:50:04,424 --> 00:50:06,967
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

675
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,260
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

676
00:50:08,344 --> 00:50:11,346
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note ...

677
00:50:11,431 --> 00:50:13,140
"The law of four." I love that.

678
00:50:13,224 --> 00:50:16,768
 ...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

679
00:50:17,937 --> 00:50:22,190
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid 
I still don't. None of us do.

680
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:24,943
Uh-huh. Nothing comes to mind?

681
00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:28,864
Nothing?

682
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:37,873
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C ...

683
00:50:37,957 --> 00:50:40,417
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

684
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:43,962
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

685
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,631
That is correct, yes.

686
00:50:50,094 --> 00:50:52,512
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting ...

687
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:56,391
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

688
00:50:57,977 --> 00:50:59,394
But I'm afraid we don't.

689
00:50:59,479 --> 00:51:01,938
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

690
00:51:02,023 --> 00:51:04,191
We're doing our goddamn job.

691
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:07,194
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

692
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:10,197
No.
What's the good news, Doctor?

693
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:12,616
Rachel's been found.

694
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:15,035
She's here.

695
00:51:16,204 --> 00:51:17,704
Safe and sound.

696
00:51:29,383 --> 00:51:31,426
There's not a mark on her.

697
00:51:35,056 --> 00:51:36,473
Who are these men?

698
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:41,436
Why are they in my house?

699
00:51:41,521 --> 00:51:46,024
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

700
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:50,737
Ma'am.

701
00:51:54,117 --> 00:51:58,703
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

702
00:51:58,788 --> 00:52:00,705
passing out literature.

703
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,708
Here?

704
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,546
In this neighborhood?

705
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,381
Yes, I'm afraid so.

706
00:52:10,758 --> 00:52:14,344
Now if you could tell us what 
you did yesterday, where you were,

707
00:52:14,428 --> 00:52:16,555
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

708
00:52:18,224 --> 00:52:19,432
Yes, um ...

709
00:52:22,186 --> 00:52:23,520
Well, I, um ...

710
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,276
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

711
00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:32,362
and then I ...

712
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,449
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

713
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:42,789
Then I sent the children 
off to school.

714
00:52:47,211 --> 00:52:48,461
And then ...

715
00:52:54,886 --> 00:52:57,929
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

716
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:06,021
I see.

717
00:53:09,734 --> 00:53:11,276
And after that?

718
00:53:15,907 --> 00:53:17,532
Um ...

719
00:53:19,452 --> 00:53:20,785
After that,

720
00:53:30,588 --> 00:53:32,214
I thought of you.

721
00:53:38,221 --> 00:53:42,182
I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't know 
what you're talking about.

722
00:53:45,186 --> 00:53:48,146
Don't you know
how lonely I've been, Jim?

723
00:53:54,111 --> 00:53:55,195
You're gone.

724
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,909
You're dead.

725
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:07,832
I cry every night.

726
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,049
How am I supposed to survive?

727
00:54:17,551 --> 00:54:18,718
God.

728
00:54:29,105 --> 00:54:32,399
Rachel, it'll be all right.

729
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:37,696
I'm so sorry, but every ...

730
00:54:39,407 --> 00:54:42,242
Everything's gonna 
be all right. Okay?

731
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:45,620
I buried you.

732
00:54:47,957 --> 00:54:50,583
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

733
00:54:50,668 --> 00:54:54,170
lumps of flesh splashing into 
the sea, eaten by sharks.

734
00:54:58,426 --> 00:55:01,052
My Jim's dead, 
so who the fuck are you?

735
00:55:04,473 --> 00:55:06,141
Who the fuck are you?

736
00:55:06,892 --> 00:55:08,018
- Who are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

737
00:55:08,102 --> 00:55:09,686
- Who are you?
- It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

738
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:12,272
Let me go! No!

739
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:16,067
- Rachel, it's okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

740
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:22,282
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

741
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:24,701
I thought she might 
tell you something.

742
00:55:24,785 --> 00:55:28,705
We found her down by the 
lighthouse, skipping stones.

743
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:30,957
We've no idea how she got out, but ...

744
00:55:31,042 --> 00:55:33,418
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

745
00:55:33,502 --> 00:55:35,462
There's food, water and cots.

746
00:55:35,546 --> 00:55:38,798
It's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

747
00:55:43,095 --> 00:55:45,305
Are you all right? You look pale.

748
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:47,182
I'm fine. It's just ...

749
00:55:48,642 --> 00:55:50,226
Boss, are you okay?

750
00:55:51,228 --> 00:55:53,813
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

751
00:55:53,898 --> 00:55:58,234
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

752
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,986
I'll be all right.

753
00:56:02,073 --> 00:56:04,324
Come on, I got you.

754
00:56:06,118 --> 00:56:07,744
What's wrong with him?

755
00:56:07,828 --> 00:56:10,246
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

756
00:56:10,331 --> 00:56:12,332
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a migraine.

757
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:14,709
Imagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

758
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:17,504
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

759
00:56:17,588 --> 00:56:19,714
- I don't ... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain.

760
00:56:19,799 --> 00:56:21,716
Marshal, take the pills.

761
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:27,680
He's going to need to lie down.

762
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:34,312
Oh, my God!

763
00:56:34,397 --> 00:56:35,730
There's broken glass
all over the floor.

764
00:56:35,815 --> 00:56:37,315
- Make sure all the meds are locked up.
- Watch your back.

765
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,483
Make sure everything's okay in Ward B.

766
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:39,859
Go down to the infirmary and see ...

767
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:41,277
if there's any more ...
- All right, Doctor.

768
00:56:41,362 --> 00:56:45,156
Give him a bed. This one here.

769
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:48,827
- Over here. All right, boss.
- Yeah, that's it.

770
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:49,994
- You have him?
- Yes.

771
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,163
Careful. All right.

772
00:56:53,249 --> 00:56:55,875
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

773
00:57:02,216 --> 00:57:03,633
Who is that?

774
00:57:03,717 --> 00:57:06,219
Him? That's the warden.

775
00:57:08,889 --> 00:57:13,184
Don't you worry about him, all right?
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

776
00:57:17,273 --> 00:57:20,692
He looks like 
an ex-military prick, huh?

777
00:57:20,776 --> 00:57:22,735
Well, you know what? I ain't 
gonna argue with you on that one.

778
00:58:49,073 --> 00:58:51,491
You should have saved me.

779
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,787
You should have saved all of us.

780
00:59:22,856 --> 00:59:26,776
Hey, buddy.

781
00:59:28,821 --> 00:59:30,071
Hey.

782
00:59:30,155 --> 00:59:31,447
Laeddis.

783
00:59:33,075 --> 00:59:34,242
Yeah.

784
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,623
My ...

785
00:59:45,129 --> 00:59:46,212
My buddy.

786
00:59:47,673 --> 00:59:49,674
No hard feelings, right?

787
00:59:53,596 --> 00:59:54,679
Yeah.

788
00:59:56,223 --> 00:59:57,890
No hard feelings.

789
01:00:11,322 --> 01:00:13,531
A little something for later,

790
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:19,621
'cause I know how much you need it.

791
01:00:25,836 --> 01:00:29,881
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

792
01:00:40,726 --> 01:00:42,477
Give me a hand here.

793
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:06,250
I could get into trouble.

794
01:01:34,655 --> 01:01:35,988
I'm dead.

795
01:01:38,951 --> 01:01:40,493
I'm so sorry.

796
01:01:42,162 --> 01:01:44,163
Why didn't you save me?

797
01:01:45,165 --> 01:01:50,795
I tried. I wanted to, but by the time
I got there, it was too late.

798
01:02:12,901 --> 01:02:14,026
See?

799
01:02:17,364 --> 01:02:19,198
Aren't they beautiful?

800
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:16,047
Why are you all wet, baby?

801
01:03:18,759 --> 01:03:20,426
Laeddis isn't dead.

802
01:03:21,804 --> 01:03:23,304
He isn't gone.

803
01:03:24,515 --> 01:03:26,098
He's still here.

804
01:03:28,393 --> 01:03:29,602
I know.

805
01:03:30,562 --> 01:03:32,063
You need to find him, Teddy.

806
01:03:32,564 --> 01:03:34,774
You need to find him
and you kill him dead.

807
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,918
It's okay.

808
01:04:03,971 --> 01:04:06,722
- Security to Ward A. Okay.
- Ward A. I got it.

809
01:04:06,807 --> 01:04:08,808
The generator room's flooded.

810
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:11,143
- Ward A. Ward A.
- See what we need in Ward B.

811
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,728
Let's go.

812
01:04:13,063 --> 01:04:14,605
You okay, boss?

813
01:04:17,234 --> 01:04:19,235
This goddamn migraine.

814
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:23,197
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

815
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:26,200
What do you want to do?

816
01:04:32,583 --> 01:04:35,585
- Christ.
- Dan? Relax. Nope, nope, nope.

817
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:38,087
You don't wanna do that. 
Put it down. Now. Put it down.

818
01:04:38,171 --> 01:04:41,757
Grab him, grab him, grab him, 
grab him! Get him, get him!

819
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:48,806
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

820
01:04:48,891 --> 01:04:51,434
You think the whole electrical 
system is fried?

821
01:04:51,518 --> 01:04:54,270
I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

822
01:04:54,354 --> 01:04:57,398
- All the electronic security, the fences ...
- Why are you always running?

823
01:04:57,482 --> 01:05:00,651
the gates, the doors.
- Why is it you every time? Come on.

824
01:05:00,736 --> 01:05:04,697
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

825
01:05:07,284 --> 01:05:10,369
- Come on.
- Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

826
01:05:15,375 --> 01:05:18,336
The guy I told you about,
George Noyce?

827
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:21,130
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

828
01:05:21,214 --> 01:05:23,841
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

829
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:28,012
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

830
01:05:28,096 --> 01:05:31,849
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

831
01:05:31,934 --> 01:05:34,644
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

832
01:05:34,728 --> 01:05:35,895
Watch your head!

833
01:05:56,208 --> 01:05:58,209
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Jesus.

834
01:05:58,502 --> 01:06:00,544
First time on Ward C, huh?

835
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:03,297
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

836
01:06:03,382 --> 01:06:04,423
We heard stories, but ...

837
01:06:04,508 --> 01:06:07,134
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

838
01:06:07,594 --> 01:06:09,762
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

839
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:12,014
but some of them are still loose.

840
01:06:12,099 --> 01:06:14,809
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

841
01:06:14,893 --> 01:06:17,269
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

842
01:06:18,355 --> 01:06:21,273
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

843
01:07:17,998 --> 01:07:19,331
He's here.

844
01:07:23,336 --> 01:07:26,756
Laeddis. I can feel him.

845
01:07:31,011 --> 01:07:32,762
Tag! You're it!

846
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:34,847
Wait! Boss! Ted!

847
01:07:44,399 --> 01:07:46,067
Hey! Hey!

848
01:07:47,527 --> 01:07:48,694
Teddy.

849
01:08:30,654 --> 01:08:32,113
Listen to me.

850
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,117
Listen, I don't wanna leave here,
all right?

851
01:08:36,576 --> 01:08:38,786
I mean, why would anybody want to?

852
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:42,331
We hear things here
about the outside world.

853
01:08:42,415 --> 01:08:45,835
- About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
- Teddy, where are you?

854
01:08:45,919 --> 01:08:47,920
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

855
01:08:48,004 --> 01:08:51,257
- I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
- Ah, that's funny.

856
01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:54,260
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

857
01:08:55,095 --> 01:08:56,679
But not the hydrogen bomb.

858
01:08:56,763 --> 01:09:02,226
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

859
01:09:02,686 --> 01:09:04,311
- Do you get it?
- Yeah! Yeah.

860
01:09:04,396 --> 01:09:05,980
- Do you?
- I get it, I get it!

861
01:09:06,064 --> 01:09:07,314
Let him go!

862
01:09:10,944 --> 01:09:12,027
No!

863
01:09:21,288 --> 01:09:23,289
No! No!

864
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,458
What are you doing?

865
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:29,461
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

866
01:09:29,796 --> 01:09:31,046
Oh, you got Billings.

867
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:33,632
What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

868
01:09:33,717 --> 01:09:34,800
Catch them, not kill them!

869
01:09:34,885 --> 01:09:37,845
- He jumped us.
- You, give me a hand with him.

870
01:09:37,929 --> 01:09:40,347
We've gotta get him to 
the infirmary. God damn it.

871
01:09:40,432 --> 01:09:43,017
No, no! Not you, not you. 
Take a walk.

872
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,146
Come on. Cawley's gonna have
my goddamn balls for this.

873
01:10:18,094 --> 01:10:20,304
Laeddis.

874
01:10:40,533 --> 01:10:42,117
Laeddis.

875
01:10:53,171 --> 01:10:55,756
Stop me, please,

876
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,383
before I kill more.

877
01:10:59,386 --> 01:11:01,887
Stop me before I kill more.

878
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:04,223
Laeddis.

879
01:11:12,315 --> 01:11:14,233
Please, please.

880
01:11:18,488 --> 01:11:20,447
I see you all.

881
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:24,576
Laeddis.

882
01:11:30,917 --> 01:11:33,669
You told me I'd be free of this place.

883
01:11:34,754 --> 01:11:36,672
You promised.

884
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:39,717
You lied.

885
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,593
Laeddis.

886
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,434
Laeddis?

887
01:11:48,893 --> 01:11:51,478
That's pretty damn funny.

888
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:56,442
- Your voice.
- Don't you recognize it?

889
01:11:57,736 --> 01:11:59,862
After all the talks we had?

890
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,823
After all the lies you told me?

891
01:12:02,907 --> 01:12:04,700
Let me see your face.

892
01:12:05,201 --> 01:12:07,161
They say I'm theirs now.

893
01:12:08,288 --> 01:12:10,622
They say I'll never leave here.

894
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:14,043
Your match is about to go out.

895
01:12:16,629 --> 01:12:19,381
- Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
- Why?

896
01:12:19,799 --> 01:12:21,258
So you can lie to me more?

897
01:12:22,135 --> 01:12:24,345
- This isn't about the truth.
- Yes, it is.

898
01:12:24,512 --> 01:12:28,015
- It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you!

899
01:12:28,308 --> 01:12:29,808
And Laeddis.

900
01:12:31,144 --> 01:12:33,103
That's all it's ever been about.

901
01:12:34,189 --> 01:12:37,900
I was incidental. A way in.

902
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:43,906
George ... George Noyce.

903
01:12:45,075 --> 01:12:48,535
No. It's not possible. 
You can't be here.

904
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:49,995
You like it?

905
01:12:51,706 --> 01:12:53,624
Who did this to you, George?

906
01:12:53,708 --> 01:12:54,958
You did.

907
01:12:55,502 --> 01:12:56,919
What the hell do you mean?

908
01:12:57,003 --> 01:13:01,173
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

909
01:13:01,257 --> 01:13:03,842
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

910
01:13:03,927 --> 01:13:05,094
However this happened, I ...

911
01:13:05,178 --> 01:13:07,137
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

912
01:13:07,222 --> 01:13:11,100
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

913
01:13:11,184 --> 01:13:13,060
Just tell me how they got you here.

914
01:13:13,144 --> 01:13:15,854
They knew! Don't you get it?

915
01:13:16,523 --> 01:13:19,316
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

916
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:23,779
This is a game. 
All of this is for you.

917
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:28,951
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

918
01:13:30,328 --> 01:13:31,537
Georgie ...

919
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:35,290
- George, you're wrong. You're wrong.
- Oh, really?

920
01:13:36,376 --> 01:13:38,377
Been alone much since you got here?

921
01:13:40,046 --> 01:13:41,713
I've been with my partner.

922
01:13:42,382 --> 01:13:44,133
You never worked with him before,
have you?

923
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:48,929
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's ...

924
01:13:49,013 --> 01:13:51,849
You never worked
with him before, have you?

925
01:13:54,644 --> 01:13:58,522
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

926
01:14:03,486 --> 01:14:05,487
Then they've already won.

927
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,575
Fuck.

928
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:17,374
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

929
01:14:19,002 --> 01:14:20,836
They're gonna cut into my brain.

930
01:14:22,297 --> 01:14:23,922
And I'm only here ...

931
01:14:24,257 --> 01:14:25,591
because of you!

932
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:29,011
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

933
01:14:29,095 --> 01:14:31,346
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

934
01:14:31,431 --> 01:14:34,183
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

935
01:14:34,267 --> 01:14:37,853
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

936
01:14:38,271 --> 01:14:41,273
- I'm not here to kill anyone.
- Liar!

937
01:14:41,357 --> 01:14:44,443
I'm not gonna kill him, 
I swear to you! I swear.

938
01:14:44,694 --> 01:14:46,069
She's dead.

939
01:14:47,113 --> 01:14:48,780
She ... Let her go.

940
01:14:50,283 --> 01:14:51,658
Let her go.

941
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:55,913
Tell him, Teddy.
Tell him why.

942
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:01,293
You gotta do it.
There's no other way.

943
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,420
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day ...

944
01:15:03,505 --> 01:15:06,381
you brought me my locket.
- You gotta do it!

945
01:15:06,466 --> 01:15:09,885
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

946
01:15:09,969 --> 01:15:12,846
She's fucking with your head.

947
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:14,806
And I told you it was from happiness.

948
01:15:14,891 --> 01:15:17,351
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

949
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:23,649
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

950
01:15:25,818 --> 01:15:27,486
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

951
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:29,446
I can't! I can't.

952
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:38,872
Then you'll never leave this island.

953
01:15:44,629 --> 01:15:45,837
Dolores.

954
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,471
He's not in this ward.

955
01:15:56,683 --> 01:15:59,685
He was transferred out of here.

956
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:06,692
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

957
01:16:12,574 --> 01:16:14,116
The lighthouse.

958
01:16:21,457 --> 01:16:22,541
Hey,

959
01:16:25,044 --> 01:16:26,545
God help you.

960
01:16:35,388 --> 01:16:36,638
Boss, we got problems.

961
01:16:36,723 --> 01:16:39,308
McPherson and Cawley
are in the building.

962
01:16:39,392 --> 01:16:41,143
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

963
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:44,104
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

964
01:16:44,188 --> 01:16:46,064
Let's get the hell out of here. 
This way.

965
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:51,403
Just keep going. We belong here.

966
01:17:01,247 --> 01:17:03,040
What happened to you?

967
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:04,750
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

968
01:17:05,126 --> 01:17:06,668
where were you?

969
01:17:07,045 --> 01:17:11,798
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

970
01:17:11,883 --> 01:17:14,009
Did you ever find Laeddis?

971
01:17:14,093 --> 01:17:16,011
No. No, I never found him.

972
01:17:16,095 --> 01:17:19,014
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

973
01:17:19,098 --> 01:17:21,224
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

974
01:17:21,309 --> 01:17:25,020
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

975
01:17:25,104 --> 01:17:26,772
Here. Take a look.

976
01:17:27,607 --> 01:17:28,940
I'll look at it later.

977
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:32,235
What's the matter, boss?

978
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:35,614
I'll look it over later, that's all.

979
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:40,952
- Ashecliffe's that way.
- I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

980
01:17:42,455 --> 01:17:44,414
I'm going to that lighthouse.

981
01:17:44,499 --> 01:17:46,833
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

982
01:18:00,973 --> 01:18:02,391
There it is.

983
01:18:03,226 --> 01:18:07,229
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

984
01:18:07,313 --> 01:18:09,523
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

985
01:18:09,607 --> 01:18:11,274
There could be a way
behind those trees.

986
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:14,444
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

987
01:18:14,529 --> 01:18:15,570
- Boss ...
- Come on.

988
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:18,031
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

989
01:18:18,116 --> 01:18:19,908
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

990
01:18:19,992 --> 01:18:22,828
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

991
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:26,498
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

992
01:18:28,835 --> 01:18:30,544
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

993
01:18:30,628 --> 01:18:32,921
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

994
01:18:33,005 --> 01:18:34,840
Because climbing down there
when it's dark ...

995
01:18:34,924 --> 01:18:38,093
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

996
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:41,596
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

997
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:45,183
You brought me into this, boss,

998
01:18:45,268 --> 01:18:48,603
and now we're trapped here on 
this rock, on this island,

999
01:18:48,688 --> 01:18:50,230
with no one to rely on but each other,

1000
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:53,775
and now you're acting like ...
- Like what? Like what?

1001
01:18:54,402 --> 01:18:55,902
How am I acting?

1002
01:19:00,199 --> 01:19:03,660
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

1003
01:19:08,374 --> 01:19:11,126
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

1004
01:19:11,711 --> 01:19:13,378
I'm from Seattle.

1005
01:19:16,007 --> 01:19:17,257
Seattle.

1006
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:21,720
I'm going on ...

1007
01:19:22,555 --> 01:19:23,764
alone.

1008
01:19:26,142 --> 01:19:29,019
- I'm going with you, boss.
- I said alone.

1009
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:31,855
Fine.

1010
01:19:58,508 --> 01:19:59,758
Damn it!

1011
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,052
Damn it.

1012
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:10,143
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

1013
01:20:10,228 --> 01:20:11,770
The tide was up.

1014
01:20:20,029 --> 01:20:24,866
Chuck!

1015
01:21:26,429 --> 01:21:27,679
Come on!

1016
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:04,215
Chuck!

1017
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,718
Where are you, Chuck?

1018
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:35,455
Chuck!

1019
01:23:19,959 --> 01:23:21,334
Who are you?

1020
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:26,297
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

1021
01:23:27,675 --> 01:23:29,384
You're the marshal.

1022
01:23:30,344 --> 01:23:32,012
That's right.

1023
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:38,059
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

1024
01:23:38,144 --> 01:23:39,978
Why? Why?

1025
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:44,482
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

1026
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:53,867
I'm gonna keep this ...

1027
01:23:55,369 --> 01:23:56,870
if you don't mind.

1028
01:23:57,705 --> 01:23:59,122
Fine by me.

1029
01:24:08,174 --> 01:24:09,507
You're ...

1030
01:24:10,926 --> 01:24:12,761
You're Rachel Solando.

1031
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:15,764
The real one.

1032
01:24:19,769 --> 01:24:21,394
Did you kill your children?

1033
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:25,023
I never had children.

1034
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,484
I was never married.

1035
01:24:29,028 --> 01:24:32,572
And before I was a patient at 
Ashecliffe, I worked here.

1036
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:35,784
You ... You were a nurse?

1037
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,080
I was a doctor, Marshal.

1038
01:24:43,501 --> 01:24:45,210
You think I'm crazy.

1039
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:48,922
- No. No, no, I never ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

1040
01:24:50,132 --> 01:24:52,550
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

1041
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:55,887
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

1042
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:01,476
People tell the world you're crazy,

1043
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:05,480
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

1044
01:25:06,065 --> 01:25:09,234
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

1045
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,820
Once you're declared insane,

1046
01:25:11,904 --> 01:25:15,406
then anything you do is called
part of that insanity.

1047
01:25:15,491 --> 01:25:21,079
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

1048
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:22,747
Survival instincts are ...

1049
01:25:23,749 --> 01:25:25,208
defense mechanisms.

1050
01:25:25,543 --> 01:25:29,254
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

1051
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:32,799
- Tell me something.
- Yeah.

1052
01:25:33,968 --> 01:25:35,760
What happened to you?

1053
01:25:36,595 --> 01:25:40,014
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal ...

1054
01:25:40,099 --> 01:25:41,850
and opium-based hallucinogens.

1055
01:25:41,934 --> 01:25:43,643
Psychotropic drugs.

1056
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,397
I asked about the surgeries, too.

1057
01:25:49,441 --> 01:25:51,609
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

1058
01:25:53,154 --> 01:25:55,864
They zap the patient 
with electroshock,

1059
01:25:55,948 --> 01:25:58,783
then go through the eye 
with an ice pick,

1060
01:26:00,953 --> 01:26:03,037
pull out some nerve fibers.

1061
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:07,917
Makes the patients much more obedient.

1062
01:26:08,002 --> 01:26:09,335
Tractable.

1063
01:26:10,796 --> 01:26:12,297
It's barbaric,

1064
01:26:13,299 --> 01:26:14,799
unconscionable.

1065
01:26:15,801 --> 01:26:19,554
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

1066
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:22,265
Depends on where you're hurt?

1067
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:24,893
No, it has nothing 
to do with the flesh.

1068
01:26:25,311 --> 01:26:27,312
The brain controls pain.

1069
01:26:28,147 --> 01:26:32,525
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

1070
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:36,654
What if you could control it?

1071
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:40,158
- You mean the brain?
- Recreate a man ...

1072
01:26:40,826 --> 01:26:45,413
so he doesn't feel pain or love
or sympathy.

1073
01:26:46,957 --> 01:26:48,416
A man who can't be interrogated,

1074
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,211
because he has no memories
to confess.

1075
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:57,467
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

1076
01:26:57,551 --> 01:27:01,679
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs ...

1077
01:27:01,764 --> 01:27:03,431
during their brainwashing experiments.

1078
01:27:03,515 --> 01:27:06,935
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

1079
01:27:07,019 --> 01:27:09,103
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world ...

1080
01:27:09,188 --> 01:27:12,440
and do things sane men ...
Sane men never would.

1081
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:15,860
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

1082
01:27:15,945 --> 01:27:18,613
that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

1083
01:27:18,697 --> 01:27:21,407
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

1084
01:27:22,660 --> 01:27:26,621
Fifty years from now, people will
look back and say, here, this place,

1085
01:27:26,956 --> 01:27:29,165
is where it all began.

1086
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:34,045
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

1087
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,341
we tested patients on Shutter Island.

1088
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,678
No, they won't.

1089
01:27:42,638 --> 01:27:43,638
No.

1090
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:48,226
You do understand ...

1091
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:53,064
that they can't let you leave.

1092
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:56,693
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

1093
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:03,157
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

1094
01:28:05,244 --> 01:28:06,869
Didn't matter.

1095
01:28:09,581 --> 01:28:13,626
Let me ask you.
Any past traumas in your life?

1096
01:28:15,004 --> 01:28:16,254
Yes.

1097
01:28:17,423 --> 01:28:19,507
But why would that matter?

1098
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:21,884
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past ...

1099
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:24,470
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

1100
01:28:24,555 --> 01:28:29,934
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

1101
01:28:30,019 --> 01:28:31,936
"Of course he cracked.

1102
01:28:32,938 --> 01:28:34,188
"Who wouldn't
after what he'd been through?"

1103
01:28:34,273 --> 01:28:36,774
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

1104
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:39,819
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

1105
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:46,868
- How's your head?
- My head?

1106
01:28:46,952 --> 01:28:50,371
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

1107
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:56,919
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

1108
01:28:57,004 --> 01:28:58,296
Jesus.

1109
01:29:00,591 --> 01:29:04,093
You haven't taken any pills, 
have you? I mean, even aspirin?

1110
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:06,346
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

1111
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:10,725
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

1112
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:14,187
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

1113
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:19,275
No.

1114
01:29:20,361 --> 01:29:21,736
No, I haven't.

1115
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,572
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics ...

1116
01:29:24,656 --> 01:29:27,241
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

1117
01:29:29,036 --> 01:29:30,870
Palsy comes first,

1118
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:35,249
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

1119
01:29:36,168 --> 01:29:40,338
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal? Huh?

1120
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:45,802
Tell me what goes on 
in that lighthouse.

1121
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:48,012
Tell me.

1122
01:29:49,181 --> 01:29:50,807
Brain surgery.

1123
01:29:51,475 --> 01:29:55,937
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

1124
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,357
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

1125
01:30:01,443 --> 01:30:03,903
That's where they create the ghosts.

1126
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:09,200
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

1127
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:12,787
Everyone.

1128
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:16,582
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

1129
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:20,461
- They couldn't possibly know ...
- Everyone.

1130
01:30:39,398 --> 01:30:40,940
You can't stay here.

1131
01:30:41,567 --> 01:30:42,859
They think I'm dead, 
that I drowned.

1132
01:30:42,943 --> 01:30:45,945
I'm afraid if they come looking 
for you, they might find me.

1133
01:30:46,029 --> 01:30:48,406
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

1134
01:30:55,038 --> 01:30:56,664
I'm gonna come back for you.

1135
01:30:56,748 --> 01:30:59,709
I won't be here. I move during 
the day. New places every night.

1136
01:30:59,793 --> 01:31:02,128
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

1137
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:04,130
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

1138
01:31:05,007 --> 01:31:08,259
The only way off the island is 
the ferry, and they control it.

1139
01:31:09,219 --> 01:31:11,262
You'll never leave here.

1140
01:31:20,606 --> 01:31:22,398
I had a friend.

1141
01:31:22,483 --> 01:31:24,984
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

1142
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:27,778
Have you seen him?

1143
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:30,281
Marshal,

1144
01:31:31,825 --> 01:31:33,951
you have no friends.

1145
01:32:06,276 --> 01:32:07,818
There you are.

1146
01:32:10,656 --> 01:32:13,324
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

1147
01:32:14,952 --> 01:32:16,494
Have a seat.

1148
01:32:16,954 --> 01:32:18,246
Come on.

1149
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:31,551
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

1150
01:32:32,636 --> 01:32:35,680
I was just looking around.

1151
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:41,060
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

1152
01:32:42,688 --> 01:32:44,021
- What?
- God's gift.

1153
01:32:46,191 --> 01:32:47,525
The violence.

1154
01:32:50,362 --> 01:32:54,740
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

1155
01:32:54,825 --> 01:32:58,661
it reached out for me 
like a divine hand.

1156
01:33:00,872 --> 01:33:02,707
God loves violence.

1157
01:33:05,377 --> 01:33:08,212
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

1158
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:11,549
Why else would there be so much of it?

1159
01:33:11,883 --> 01:33:13,259
It's in us.

1160
01:33:13,802 --> 01:33:15,136
It's what we are.

1161
01:33:16,555 --> 01:33:18,889
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

1162
01:33:18,974 --> 01:33:21,517
and pillage and plunder and tear 
at the flesh of our brothers.

1163
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:25,521
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

1164
01:33:28,734 --> 01:33:31,152
I thought God gave us moral order.

1165
01:33:31,236 --> 01:33:34,238
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

1166
01:33:34,865 --> 01:33:38,409
There's no moral order at all.
There's just this,

1167
01:33:39,036 --> 01:33:41,203
can my violence conquer yours?

1168
01:33:46,585 --> 01:33:49,003
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

1169
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:52,548
You're as violent as they come.

1170
01:33:53,258 --> 01:33:56,844
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

1171
01:33:56,928 --> 01:33:59,096
If the constraints 
of society were lifted,

1172
01:33:59,181 --> 01:34:01,849
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

1173
01:34:01,933 --> 01:34:05,311
you would crack my skull with 
a rock and eat my meaty parts.

1174
01:34:07,272 --> 01:34:08,856
Wouldn't you?

1175
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:14,070
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

1176
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:16,030
but I know different.

1177
01:34:16,657 --> 01:34:18,407
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

1178
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:21,118
- No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
- Oh, I know you.

1179
01:34:21,745 --> 01:34:24,455
We've known each other for centuries.

1180
01:34:33,799 --> 01:34:36,717
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

1181
01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:40,137
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

1182
01:34:44,267 --> 01:34:45,893
Give it a try.

1183
01:34:47,437 --> 01:34:49,146
That's the spirit.

1184
01:35:23,890 --> 01:35:27,226
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

1185
01:35:28,145 --> 01:35:29,812
- Not really.
- Something I've seen.

1186
01:35:29,896 --> 01:35:31,147
Okay.

1187
01:35:36,361 --> 01:35:38,112
Where have you been?

1188
01:35:38,196 --> 01:35:40,948
Oh, just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

1189
01:35:41,032 --> 01:35:44,702
Oh, I forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

1190
01:35:45,537 --> 01:35:46,954
- Stop looking at him.
- For sure. Yeah.

1191
01:35:47,038 --> 01:35:49,081
Stop looking at him. 
Stop looking at him.

1192
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:52,209
- Big meeting?
- Oh, yes.

1193
01:35:52,294 --> 01:35:53,544
- It's okay. I'm ...
- I don't like that.

1194
01:35:54,212 --> 01:35:56,213
Apparently there was
an unidentified man ...

1195
01:35:56,298 --> 01:35:57,590
in Ward C yesterday.

1196
01:35:57,674 --> 01:36:01,051
He subdued a highly dangerous 
patient quite handily.

1197
01:36:01,636 --> 01:36:02,636
Is that so?

1198
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:05,181
It seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

1199
01:36:05,265 --> 01:36:06,474
George Noyce.

1200
01:36:06,558 --> 01:36:09,351
Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

1201
01:36:09,436 --> 01:36:11,145
We're gated down. We're fine.

1202
01:36:11,229 --> 01:36:15,274
This Noyce, you said his name was,
he's delusional?

1203
01:36:15,358 --> 01:36:18,068
Oh, extremely.
He can be quite upsetting.

1204
01:36:18,153 --> 01:36:19,862
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

1205
01:36:19,946 --> 01:36:24,408
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

1206
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:26,577
- Hmm.
- Cigarette?

1207
01:36:28,872 --> 01:36:30,664
No, thanks. I quit.

1208
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:35,795
- So you're taking the ferry?
- Yes, absolutely.

1209
01:36:35,879 --> 01:36:38,589
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so ...

1210
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,758
"We," Marshal?

1211
01:36:42,761 --> 01:36:46,347
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

1212
01:36:46,431 --> 01:36:47,598
Who?

1213
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:50,142
My partner, Chuck.

1214
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:55,314
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

1215
01:36:57,776 --> 01:36:59,944
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

1216
01:37:00,028 --> 01:37:03,197
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

1217
01:37:03,281 --> 01:37:05,366
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

1218
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:09,036
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

1219
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,081
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

1220
01:37:13,917 --> 01:37:15,543
I can see that.

1221
01:37:17,462 --> 01:37:18,587
Mmm.

1222
01:37:19,631 --> 01:37:22,258
So, tell me again about your partner.

1223
01:37:23,969 --> 01:37:25,594
What partner?

1224
01:37:28,348 --> 01:37:29,431
It's fine.

1225
01:38:17,772 --> 01:38:21,191
She made a mess.
I cleaned it up. She made a mess again.

1226
01:38:30,869 --> 01:38:32,244
Marshal,

1227
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:35,247
going somewhere?

1228
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:38,459
I'm just heading out 
to the ferry, so ...

1229
01:38:38,543 --> 01:38:42,087
Ah! Oh, well, 
I'm afraid it's the other way.

1230
01:38:43,632 --> 01:38:44,715
Oh?

1231
01:38:45,717 --> 01:38:50,387
If you'll wait a moment, I'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

1232
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:58,896
- What's this, Doctor? Huh? What's this?
- It's just a sedative.

1233
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:02,149
- A precaution.
- Oh! A precaution.

1234
01:39:04,361 --> 01:39:07,947
What are you going to do? Kill me?

1235
01:39:08,281 --> 01:39:11,075
- Marshal.
- You think you deserve it?

1236
01:39:11,159 --> 01:39:13,953
For what, hmm? Provoking you?

1237
01:39:14,746 --> 01:39:17,581
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

1238
01:39:18,124 --> 01:39:21,085
- Remarks? Words?
- Nazis?

1239
01:39:21,711 --> 01:39:25,756
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

1240
01:39:26,841 --> 01:39:31,095
Did you know that the word "trauma"
comes from the Greek for "wound"?

1241
01:39:31,763 --> 01:39:34,515
And what is the German word
for "dream"?

1242
01:39:34,599 --> 01:39:36,767
Traum. Ein Traum.

1243
01:39:38,144 --> 01:39:41,105
Wounds can create monsters,
and you ...

1244
01:39:41,773 --> 01:39:44,149
You are wounded, Marshal.

1245
01:39:45,193 --> 01:39:48,362
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

1246
01:39:49,072 --> 01:39:50,823
you must stop it?

1247
01:39:51,408 --> 01:39:52,616
Yeah.

1248
01:39:53,785 --> 01:39:55,619
- I agree.
- Yes.

1249
01:39:56,454 --> 01:39:57,538
Yeah.

1250
01:40:14,764 --> 01:40:17,016
I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

1251
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,185
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

1252
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:21,520
How long you been the clock?

1253
01:40:21,604 --> 01:40:23,981
I've been on for 18 hours straight.

1254
01:40:24,441 --> 01:40:25,983
Nice paycheck.

1255
01:40:42,459 --> 01:40:44,543
What are you doing, baby?

1256
01:40:49,340 --> 01:40:51,842
- You gotta get to the ferry.
- No.

1257
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:53,886
No, no.

1258
01:40:55,096 --> 01:40:56,263
Yeah.

1259
01:40:57,390 --> 01:41:02,269
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

1260
01:41:03,354 --> 01:41:05,606
There's only one place they'd take him.

1261
01:41:08,234 --> 01:41:10,778
- You go there and you'll die.
- He's my partner.

1262
01:41:10,862 --> 01:41:12,946
If they are hurting him, if they're 
holding him against his will,

1263
01:41:13,031 --> 01:41:14,740
I've gotta bring him out.

1264
01:41:14,949 --> 01:41:16,992
I can't lose anyone else.

1265
01:41:17,077 --> 01:41:18,327
Don't go, Teddy, please.

1266
01:41:18,411 --> 01:41:21,830
- Please, don't do this. Don't go.
- I'm sorry, honey.

1267
01:41:25,418 --> 01:41:27,211
I'm sorry, honey.

1268
01:41:28,296 --> 01:41:31,340
I love this thing
because you gave it to me,

1269
01:41:33,718 --> 01:41:35,552
but the truth is ...

1270
01:41:37,222 --> 01:41:39,389
it is one fucking ugly tie.

1271
01:42:19,597 --> 01:42:20,764
No.

1272
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:44,056
Don't move. Stay where you are.

1273
01:43:46,059 --> 01:43:47,476
Are you gonna kill me?

1274
01:43:49,145 --> 01:43:51,688
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

1275
01:45:44,302 --> 01:45:46,178
Why are you all wet, baby?

1276
01:45:48,389 --> 01:45:51,641
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

1277
01:46:04,739 --> 01:46:06,990
The rifle's empty, by the way.

1278
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:14,998
Have a seat.

1279
01:46:21,506 --> 01:46:23,924
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

1280
01:46:25,551 --> 01:46:26,676
All right.

1281
01:46:30,223 --> 01:46:32,140
How badly did you hurt the guard?

1282
01:46:33,851 --> 01:46:36,853
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1283
01:46:40,024 --> 01:46:41,942
Yes, he's here.

1284
01:46:42,026 --> 01:46:46,029
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look
at your man before you send him up.

1285
01:46:46,114 --> 01:46:50,826
So Dr. Sheehan came in on the ferry
this morning, huh?

1286
01:46:51,786 --> 01:46:53,286
Not exactly.

1287
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:57,374
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

1288
01:46:58,292 --> 01:47:00,377
Sorry to hear about that.

1289
01:47:03,673 --> 01:47:06,049
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

1290
01:47:06,676 --> 01:47:09,094
How are the hallucinations?

1291
01:47:09,178 --> 01:47:13,348
Get out of here, Teddy.
This place is gonna be the end of you.

1292
01:47:17,103 --> 01:47:18,228
Not bad.

1293
01:47:18,312 --> 01:47:20,897
- They'll get worse.
- I know.

1294
01:47:21,774 --> 01:47:26,069
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

1295
01:47:26,612 --> 01:47:29,072
Did she, now? And when was this?

1296
01:47:29,157 --> 01:47:33,952
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

1297
01:47:34,036 --> 01:47:36,580
- But you'll never get to her.
- I don't doubt it,

1298
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,207
considering she's not real.

1299
01:47:41,127 --> 01:47:44,254
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

1300
01:47:45,465 --> 01:47:47,632
You're not on neuroleptics.

1301
01:47:48,092 --> 01:47:49,968
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

1302
01:47:50,052 --> 01:47:52,679
Then what the fuck is this? Huh?
What the fuck is this?

1303
01:47:52,763 --> 01:47:53,763
Withdrawal.

1304
01:47:54,765 --> 01:47:56,725
Withdrawal? From what?

1305
01:47:56,809 --> 01:47:59,144
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

1306
01:47:59,228 --> 01:48:00,854
Chlorpromazine.

1307
01:48:01,689 --> 01:48:04,941
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case ...

1308
01:48:05,443 --> 01:48:08,695
- Chloraproma-what?
- Chlorpromazine.

1309
01:48:08,779 --> 01:48:12,782
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

1310
01:48:14,076 --> 01:48:16,203
Oh, so for the past two years, you ...

1311
01:48:16,287 --> 01:48:19,581
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

1312
01:48:19,665 --> 01:48:21,124
Not Boston.

1313
01:48:21,626 --> 01:48:22,792
Here.

1314
01:48:23,586 --> 01:48:27,547
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

1315
01:48:31,302 --> 01:48:33,470
After everything 
I've seen here, Doctor,

1316
01:48:35,139 --> 01:48:38,558
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

1317
01:48:38,643 --> 01:48:40,602
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

1318
01:48:40,686 --> 01:48:42,562
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

1319
01:48:42,647 --> 01:48:44,523
You were a U.S. Marshal.

1320
01:48:44,607 --> 01:48:48,401
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

1321
01:48:48,486 --> 01:48:49,861
Proof of the 67th patient.

1322
01:48:49,946 --> 01:48:51,112
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

1323
01:48:51,197 --> 01:48:52,989
you could have blown the lid
off this place.

1324
01:48:53,074 --> 01:48:54,449
- Wait. Where did ... Where did you ...
- Yet somehow,

1325
01:48:54,534 --> 01:48:57,452
you couldn't find time to look at it.
Well, read it now.

1326
01:48:58,329 --> 01:48:59,704
Go ahead.

1327
01:49:03,501 --> 01:49:07,337
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

1328
01:49:07,421 --> 01:49:10,006
"Present for the liberation of Dachau.

1329
01:49:11,259 --> 01:49:13,885
"Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

1330
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:17,222
"Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever ...

1331
01:49:17,306 --> 01:49:18,348
"Ever took place.

1332
01:49:18,432 --> 01:49:20,308
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

1333
01:49:20,393 --> 01:49:22,769
"which preclude
facing the truth of his actions."

1334
01:49:22,853 --> 01:49:25,522
I've had enough of this bullshit!
Where's my partner, huh?

1335
01:49:25,606 --> 01:49:27,190
Where's Chuck? Where is he?

1336
01:49:27,984 --> 01:49:29,693
Let's try this another way.

1337
01:49:29,777 --> 01:49:32,320
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

1338
01:49:32,405 --> 01:49:33,822
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you ...

1339
01:49:33,906 --> 01:49:35,782
I'm afraid I have to.

1340
01:49:37,827 --> 01:49:39,995
Notice anything
these four names have in common?

1341
01:49:40,204 --> 01:49:41,705
It's your rule of four.

1342
01:49:42,164 --> 01:49:43,290
Andrew, what do you see?

1343
01:49:43,374 --> 01:49:46,376
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of ...

1344
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,878
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

1345
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,382
The names have the same letters.

1346
01:49:53,259 --> 01:49:56,678
Edward Daniels has exactly the 
same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

1347
01:49:56,762 --> 01:49:58,972
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

1348
01:49:59,056 --> 01:50:01,141
The names are anagrams
for each other.

1349
01:50:01,225 --> 01:50:03,810
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

1350
01:50:03,894 --> 01:50:06,688
You came here for the truth. 
Here it is.

1351
01:50:06,772 --> 01:50:08,773
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

1352
01:50:08,858 --> 01:50:12,402
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

1353
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:15,196
Bullshit.

1354
01:50:15,281 --> 01:50:17,490
You were committed here 
by court order 24 months ago.

1355
01:50:17,575 --> 01:50:20,910
Your crime is terrible, one 
you can't forgive yourself for,

1356
01:50:20,995 --> 01:50:23,330
so you invented another self.

1357
01:50:25,541 --> 01:50:26,958
All right.

1358
01:50:27,460 --> 01:50:30,128
Let's get down
to the facts, all right?

1359
01:50:30,212 --> 01:50:33,089
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

1360
01:50:33,174 --> 01:50:37,218
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal, only
here at Ashecliffe because of a case,

1361
01:50:37,303 --> 01:50:38,803
and you've uncovered a conspiracy ...

1362
01:50:38,888 --> 01:50:42,432
so that anything we tell you
about who you are, what you've done,

1363
01:50:42,516 --> 01:50:44,559
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

1364
01:50:44,644 --> 01:50:45,935
My name is Edward Daniels.

1365
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:50,273
I've been hearing this fantasy for 
two years now. I know every detail.

1366
01:50:50,358 --> 01:50:52,317
Patient 67, the storm,

1367
01:50:52,401 --> 01:50:55,612
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

1368
01:50:55,696 --> 01:50:58,114
You were at Dachau, but you may 
not have killed any guards.

1369
01:51:02,161 --> 01:51:05,830
I wish I could let you
just live in your fantasy world.

1370
01:51:05,915 --> 01:51:07,374
I really do.

1371
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:10,460
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

1372
01:51:10,544 --> 01:51:12,837
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

1373
01:51:12,922 --> 01:51:15,215
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

1374
01:51:15,299 --> 01:51:17,217
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

1375
01:51:17,301 --> 01:51:19,552
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

1376
01:51:19,637 --> 01:51:21,513
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't!

1377
01:51:21,597 --> 01:51:23,682
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

1378
01:51:23,766 --> 01:51:26,142
Because he called you Laeddis,

1379
01:51:26,227 --> 01:51:29,270
and you'd do anything not to be him.

1380
01:51:29,355 --> 01:51:32,941
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

1381
01:51:33,025 --> 01:51:37,070
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

1382
01:51:38,989 --> 01:51:41,491
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

1383
01:51:41,575 --> 01:51:43,451
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

1384
01:51:43,536 --> 01:51:46,913
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

1385
01:51:46,997 --> 01:51:49,124
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

1386
01:51:49,208 --> 01:51:51,209
You almost killed him.

1387
01:51:52,878 --> 01:51:55,672
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

1388
01:51:55,756 --> 01:51:57,465
It's been decided ...

1389
01:51:57,550 --> 01:52:00,385
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now,

1390
01:52:00,678 --> 01:52:01,970
right now,

1391
01:52:02,263 --> 01:52:05,682
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

1392
01:52:09,186 --> 01:52:12,522
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

1393
01:52:16,777 --> 01:52:18,695
Yeah, I understand.

1394
01:52:19,530 --> 01:52:21,740
I understand just fine.

1395
01:52:22,366 --> 01:52:26,453
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

1396
01:52:26,537 --> 01:52:29,664
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

1397
01:52:30,124 --> 01:52:31,499
But what about my partner?

1398
01:52:31,584 --> 01:52:36,045
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

1399
01:52:37,923 --> 01:52:39,382
Hello, boss.

1400
01:52:56,233 --> 01:52:59,402
What the fuck
is going on here? Hmm?

1401
01:53:00,488 --> 01:53:01,571
Huh?

1402
01:53:01,906 --> 01:53:05,533
You working for him?

1403
01:53:06,368 --> 01:53:07,869
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

1404
01:53:07,953 --> 01:53:10,872
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

1405
01:53:13,751 --> 01:53:15,877
You been watching me, huh?

1406
01:53:16,837 --> 01:53:18,922
Watching me every minute.

1407
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:21,132
Who are you?

1408
01:53:21,884 --> 01:53:22,967
Who are you? Tell me.

1409
01:53:23,636 --> 01:53:25,637
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

1410
01:53:27,056 --> 01:53:30,767
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

1411
01:53:31,352 --> 01:53:33,228
I'm Lester Sheehan.

1412
01:53:39,693 --> 01:53:42,362
- I told you ― I told you about my wife, I ―
- I know.

1413
01:53:42,446 --> 01:53:45,698
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

1414
01:53:45,783 --> 01:53:49,410
I risked everything to come in here
after you. Everything!

1415
01:53:49,495 --> 01:53:52,247
- I know, boss.
- We're running out of time here, Andrew.

1416
01:53:53,791 --> 01:53:55,375
I swore before 
the Board of Overseers ...

1417
01:53:55,459 --> 01:53:59,379
that I could construct the most 
radical, cutting-edge role-play ...

1418
01:53:59,463 --> 01:54:01,714
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

1419
01:54:01,799 --> 01:54:04,175
I thought that if we let 
you play this out ...

1420
01:54:04,927 --> 01:54:08,555
we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

1421
01:54:09,640 --> 01:54:12,100
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

1422
01:54:12,184 --> 01:54:15,478
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

1423
01:54:15,563 --> 01:54:17,355
The satanic ORs?

1424
01:54:30,995 --> 01:54:34,539
Andrew, listen to me.

1425
01:54:35,249 --> 01:54:36,833
If we fail with you,

1426
01:54:37,585 --> 01:54:41,504
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

1427
01:54:43,632 --> 01:54:46,801
We're on the front lines of a war
here, old boy.

1428
01:54:47,553 --> 01:54:50,430
And right now, 
it all comes down to you.

1429
01:54:57,354 --> 01:55:00,064
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

1430
01:55:00,149 --> 01:55:03,359
My name is Edward Daniels!

1431
01:55:03,444 --> 01:55:05,486
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

1432
01:55:05,571 --> 01:55:08,156
I see. And that's your firearm, 
Marshal? You're sure?

1433
01:55:08,240 --> 01:55:09,449
My initials are on the side.

1434
01:55:09,533 --> 01:55:11,826
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

1435
01:55:11,911 --> 01:55:14,037
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

1436
01:55:14,121 --> 01:55:15,163
Then blast away.

1437
01:55:15,247 --> 01:55:18,583
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

1438
01:55:24,673 --> 01:55:26,549
Andrew, please don't.

1439
01:55:37,436 --> 01:55:38,728
My gun.

1440
01:55:45,319 --> 01:55:47,904
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

1441
01:55:48,322 --> 01:55:50,490
It's a toy, Andrew.

1442
01:55:52,993 --> 01:55:55,078
We're telling you the truth.

1443
01:55:55,579 --> 01:55:58,831
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

1444
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:02,585
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

1445
01:56:02,670 --> 01:56:03,795
You moved to that lake house ...

1446
01:56:03,879 --> 01:56:07,006
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

1447
01:56:07,091 --> 01:56:08,383
- You were ...
- You're lying!

1448
01:56:08,467 --> 01:56:11,928
- Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
- You drugged the cigarettes!

1449
01:56:12,012 --> 01:56:13,846
- All you've done is lie!
- Andrew. Andrew.

1450
01:56:13,931 --> 01:56:16,474
Your children. 
Andrew, your children.

1451
01:56:17,226 --> 01:56:19,894
Simon. Henry.

1452
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:21,562
I never had any children.

1453
01:56:21,647 --> 01:56:25,692
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

1454
01:56:25,776 --> 01:56:28,987
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of ...

1455
01:56:29,697 --> 01:56:31,364
every night.

1456
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:32,615
I never had a little girl.

1457
01:56:32,700 --> 01:56:36,285
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

1458
01:56:36,370 --> 01:56:38,287
saved them all.

1459
01:56:38,372 --> 01:56:40,832
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

1460
01:56:40,916 --> 01:56:43,793
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

1461
01:56:44,545 --> 01:56:46,295
Andrew, are you?

1462
01:57:09,278 --> 01:57:11,362
I'm so sorry, baby.

1463
01:57:15,743 --> 01:57:18,119
I told you not to come in here.

1464
01:57:18,579 --> 01:57:22,540
I told you this 
would be the end of you.

1465
01:57:42,895 --> 01:57:44,228
I'm back!

1466
01:57:44,855 --> 01:57:47,607
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

1467
01:57:47,691 --> 01:57:50,234
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

1468
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:52,403
I could sleep for a week.

1469
01:57:56,366 --> 01:58:05,917
Dolores?

1470
01:58:10,714 --> 01:58:13,007
And he said, "Take up
your bed and walk." But God?

1471
01:58:13,092 --> 01:58:14,133
Dolores?

1472
01:58:14,218 --> 01:58:15,510
Then he said, "Take up
your bed and walk."

1473
01:58:15,594 --> 01:58:17,595
Forgive sins, but God?

1474
01:58:28,565 --> 01:58:29,941
Dolores?

1475
01:58:55,259 --> 01:58:56,509
Baby,

1476
01:58:58,554 --> 01:59:00,429
why are you all wet?

1477
01:59:02,766 --> 01:59:04,308
I missed you.

1478
01:59:11,692 --> 01:59:13,359
I wanna go home.

1479
01:59:16,488 --> 01:59:17,989
You are home.

1480
01:59:23,162 --> 01:59:24,996
Where are the kids?

1481
01:59:27,624 --> 01:59:28,624
Hmm?

1482
01:59:29,042 --> 01:59:30,793
They're in school.

1483
01:59:34,965 --> 01:59:36,966
It's Saturday, honey.

1484
01:59:38,135 --> 01:59:40,344
School's not in on Saturday.

1485
01:59:42,973 --> 01:59:44,599
My school is.

1486
01:59:57,946 --> 01:59:59,488
Oh, my God.

1487
02:00:01,783 --> 02:00:03,242
Oh, my God!

1488
02:00:16,381 --> 02:00:19,091
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1489
02:00:23,263 --> 02:00:24,847
Oh, my God, no.

1490
02:00:28,936 --> 02:00:29,936
Come on, come on.

1491
02:00:44,243 --> 02:00:47,370
No. No. Please, God.

1492
02:00:49,373 --> 02:00:50,873
Please, God, no!

1493
02:00:51,083 --> 02:00:54,126
No!

1494
02:00:56,380 --> 02:01:07,890
No.

1495
02:01:52,269 --> 02:01:53,477
Baby.

1496
02:02:12,289 --> 02:02:14,790
Let's put them 
at the table, Andrew.

1497
02:02:15,625 --> 02:02:18,836
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

1498
02:02:21,006 --> 02:02:23,424
They'll be our living dolls. Huh?

1499
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:30,222
Tomorrow we can take 
them on a picnic.

1500
02:02:35,228 --> 02:02:37,188
If you ever loved me, Dolores,

1501
02:02:38,565 --> 02:02:40,107
please stop talking.

1502
02:02:46,323 --> 02:02:47,823
I love you.

1503
02:02:56,541 --> 02:02:58,125
Set me free.

1504
02:03:02,798 --> 02:03:04,215
Oh, baby.

1505
02:03:07,677 --> 02:03:09,595
We'll give them baths.

1506
02:03:12,849 --> 02:03:16,060
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

1507
02:03:16,144 --> 02:03:17,937
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

1508
02:03:18,021 --> 02:03:19,021
I love you. I ...

1509
02:03:42,963 --> 02:03:45,548
Oh, baby.

1510
02:03:51,346 --> 02:03:52,680
Andrew.

1511
02:03:54,724 --> 02:03:56,725
Andrew, can you hear me?

1512
02:03:57,018 --> 02:04:00,896
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

1513
02:04:03,150 --> 02:04:04,442
Rachel?

1514
02:04:06,945 --> 02:04:08,404
Rachel who?

1515
02:04:11,283 --> 02:04:13,367
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

1516
02:04:14,536 --> 02:04:16,287
My daughter.

1517
02:04:19,875 --> 02:04:21,625
Why are you here?

1518
02:04:24,838 --> 02:04:26,380
Because I killed my wife.

1519
02:04:26,465 --> 02:04:28,591
And why did you do that?

1520
02:04:32,095 --> 02:04:35,264
Because she murdered our children,

1521
02:04:38,185 --> 02:04:39,727
and she told me to let her go.

1522
02:04:43,773 --> 02:04:46,942
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

1523
02:04:49,279 --> 02:04:51,739
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

1524
02:04:51,823 --> 02:04:55,784
- Why?
- We need to hear you say it.

1525
02:05:02,375 --> 02:05:05,586
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

1526
02:05:07,631 --> 02:05:09,590
Dolores told me she ...

1527
02:05:10,550 --> 02:05:14,803
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

1528
02:05:16,806 --> 02:05:21,519
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

1529
02:05:21,603 --> 02:05:25,814
just pulling the wires just for fun.

1530
02:05:29,486 --> 02:05:31,278
She told me that.

1531
02:05:32,739 --> 02:05:35,574
She told me that, 
but I didn't listen.

1532
02:05:39,287 --> 02:05:41,580
I loved her so much, you know.

1533
02:05:42,999 --> 02:05:44,625
Why did you make them up?

1534
02:05:47,254 --> 02:05:51,173
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

1535
02:05:55,011 --> 02:05:56,345
And I ...

1536
02:05:58,848 --> 02:06:03,352
I killed them 'cause I didn't 
get her help, you know.

1537
02:06:07,566 --> 02:06:09,191
I killed them.

1538
02:06:13,989 --> 02:06:15,114
Here's my fear, Andrew.

1539
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:18,409
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

1540
02:06:18,493 --> 02:06:19,493
and then you regressed.

1541
02:06:22,038 --> 02:06:25,374
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

1542
02:06:26,876 --> 02:06:28,669
You reset, Andrew.

1543
02:06:29,129 --> 02:06:33,215
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

1544
02:06:34,467 --> 02:06:35,926
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough ...

1545
02:06:36,011 --> 02:06:39,138
to stop it 
from ever happening again,

1546
02:06:39,222 --> 02:06:42,725
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

1547
02:06:49,232 --> 02:06:51,984
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

1548
02:06:53,862 --> 02:06:57,740
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

1549
02:07:09,544 --> 02:07:12,421
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

1550
02:07:19,429 --> 02:07:22,890
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

1551
02:07:47,624 --> 02:07:49,625
How we doing this morning?

1552
02:07:50,210 --> 02:07:53,462
- Good. And you?
- Can't complain.

1553
02:08:03,765 --> 02:08:05,349
So what's our next move?

1554
02:08:06,643 --> 02:08:08,102
You tell me.

1555
02:08:13,316 --> 02:08:15,150
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

1556
02:08:16,319 --> 02:08:17,611
Get back to the mainland.

1557
02:08:17,696 --> 02:08:20,656
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

1558
02:08:42,595 --> 02:08:45,597
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

1559
02:08:51,354 --> 02:08:54,189
That's right. 
We're too smart for them.

1560
02:08:55,316 --> 02:08:57,443
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

1561
02:09:13,084 --> 02:09:15,836
You know,
this place makes me wonder ...

1562
02:09:16,379 --> 02:09:18,464
Yeah, what's that, boss?

1563
02:09:19,424 --> 02:09:21,383
Which would be worse,

1564
02:09:22,218 --> 02:09:23,886
to live as a monster ...

1565
02:09:24,804 --> 02:09:26,472
or to die as a good man?

1566
02:09:36,191 --> 02:09:37,483
Teddy?
