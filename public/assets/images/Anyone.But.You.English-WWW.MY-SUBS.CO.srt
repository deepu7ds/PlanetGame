1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Excuse me.

2
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,220
Sorry.

3
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,390
Excuse me.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sorry.

5
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,460
Hi. Where's your bathroom?

6
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,000
It's for customers only.

7
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, okay. I'll buy something.

8
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,000
You gotta pay up there.

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,820
Can I just go now? I really have to pee.

10
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,000
I've got a large cappuccino for Skylar.

11
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,250
Thanks.

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,250
I also kind of, well, no...

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,010
I know that establishments that 
serve food or drink must

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,970
be open to the public regardless 
of their purchasing class.

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,000
Sorry, it's our policy.

16
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,190
Store policy can't really 
supersede state law.

17
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,440
Please, it's an emergency.

18
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,460
Caramel latte for Miranda.

19
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,370
Honey, I'm about to order. 
Do you want your usual?

20
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,000
Uh.

21
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,370
My wife would like a double espresso

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,380
although you've had trouble 
sleeping lately, right babe?

23
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,900
Maybe we should back it off to a single.

24
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,670
You kept the light on until 
like midnight last night.

25
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,450
I did, didn't I?

26
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,750
Yeah, so maybe I'll just have 
a peppermint tea with two sugars.

27
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,010
Thanks, husband.

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, and the bread. 
It's grilled cheese night.

29
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,000
And she is part of the purchasing class, 
so can we get the bathroom key?

30
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,890
Thank you.

31
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,000
Thank you. That was really nice.

32
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,510
Happy to.

33
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,000
You knew a lot about bathroom law.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It was a short chapter.

35
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh.

37
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll have your tea waiting for you.

38
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,000
Can't leave my wife.

39
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh.

40
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay. That's great. 
I will see you on the other side.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hallie, I just met this guy and 
I don't know, it was something.

42
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:53,090
Well, I know it's been a while, 
but I'm pretty sure he bought me

43
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,000
a tea and he might have just stolen my coat.

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But what do I do?

45
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,270
Oh no, this is the time that I'm supposed 
to be meeting people and doing things.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
Hallie, I gotta call you back.

47
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,100
God damn it.

48
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,190
Are you okay?

49
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,000
Big time. I am big time okay.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,890
I just had to pee for like the last 
six hours and I just started this new internship.

51
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,200
And I didn't want to ask anyone 
where the bathroom was because

52
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,460
I didn't want them to think I was 
weak and not a problem solver.

53
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,920
And by the way, it is not me to ask where the bathroom is. 
Every human does it. It's very, very normal.

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

56
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,440
Peppermint tea, two sugars.

57
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,670
Thank you. And thanks for not stealing my coat.

58
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,330
Oh.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hi.

60
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you.

61
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,290
Oh, hey.

62
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,000
You...

63
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,000
So are you going to ask me out now?

64
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,270
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

65
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,780
I'm Ben.

66
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm Bea.

67
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,000
So if we were getting attacked by giant spiders, 
you would not be able to protect us?

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, no. You'd be dead.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,680
You would let me die?

70
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,740
I'm not going to let you die. 
I'm just going to survive.

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,000
You're right. You're right. You're right.

72
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,620
I was a gymnast.

73
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,910
Gymnast?

74
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Yes. For like five years. 
I got like sixth place on beam.

75
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,000
Sixth place?

76
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Yes. Got a ribbon.

77
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,250
I'm impressed.

78
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,680
Everybody gets a ribbon.

79
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,000
All right, wait to cool down. 
You just saw me take it off the burning stove.

80
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, my God.

81
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,910
If you're going to be a lawyer, 
you got to understand negligence

82
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,370
and breach and McDonald's 
versus that lady's habeas corpus.

83
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,370
You used none of those terms properly.

84
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,210
How do you know? 
You're not a lawyer yet.

85
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,320
It's not too late to choose 
a more noble profession.

86
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,510
Oh, like you?

87
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,360
You're right. Stick with it. 
I'm going to need a lawyer at some point.

88
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't even know if I want to be a lawyer.

89
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,090
I cannot believe I just said that out loud.

90
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,850
I'm sorry. My life is a disaster right now.

91
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,430
Might be turning the corner. You just met me.

92
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,000
Or I might end up in a suitcase.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,170
I mean, look at this place.

94
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,750
It looks like every serial killer 
reenactment documentary.

95
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,230
Why do you have a giant wrench?

96
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,000
Okay, it wouldn't be a suitcase. 
It'd be a carry-on because you're zero feet tall.

97
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,170
And my mom gave me that. She said no matter how 
broken something is, there's always a way to fix it.

98
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,110
I'm sorry. I don't know why I'm 
talking to you about my mom right now.

99
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,000
Alright. Then tell me about that.

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,220
That is a long story. Everybody survived.

101
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,000
Great.

102
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,000
Holly, I don't know this guy. 
He's fucking great.

103
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,860
Yo, let's go, Benny. Come on, 
cupcake. We're gonna be late.

104
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
'Sup, Pete.

105
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,570
No way. You cooked?

106
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,470
That girl you blew me off for stayed over?

107
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,100
He asked me out and then I kind 
of asked him out and then we

108
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,740
just walked around the city 
and we fell asleep talking.

109
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,360
I don't-- I left before you could wake up.

110
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't know why. Why did I?

111
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,200
What the fuck am I doing?

112
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,950
Okay, I love you. Bye. 
I'm so sorry I woke you up. I didn't--

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This whole thing is so new to me.

114
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Bye.

115
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,080
You got cheese and bread.

116
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,040
You didn't miss one ingredient.

117
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,420
What you doing with that?

118
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,060
Why you got the giant wrench?

119
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,690
You told her about your mom, bro?

120
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,030
You don't tell nobody about your mom.

121
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,400
Fuck, dog.

122
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,080
You in love, man.

123
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
About fucking time, man.

124
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,950
My boy's in love.

125
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,920
Fuck that.

126
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
I couldn't get her out of here fast enough.

127
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,120
This girl's a disaster.

128
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,080
She's a nothing.

129
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,640
Want to get a mansion, 
a jacuzzi, a theater

130
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,000
to watch my movies, a couple whips 
and lots of fancy things.

131
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,800
The kids, they call the goonies.

132
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,560
I see the future crystal ball, 
mirror, mirror,

133
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,480
hanging on the wall.

134
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,440
Got your girlfriend screaming all the cops.

135
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
Hey.

136
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,440
Hey.

137
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,240
Claudia.

138
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,040
Holly.

139
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,090
There we go.

140
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,500
Hey, what's up, Glee?

141
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,170
Ben, this is Holly, my new girlfriend.

142
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,440
Are we saying that now?

143
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,720
Yeah, is that cool?

144
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,280
Yeah, I mean, I don't really like labels,

145
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,200
but I like you a whole bunch.

146
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,520
I like your friend a whole bunch.

147
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,040
And if she wants to put a label on me,

148
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,240
then she can sew it on wherever she wants.

149
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
That was weird.

150
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
That was weird.

151
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,640
I'm not into S&M or anything like that,

152
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,840
unless you are, which would be 
totally cool, you know?

153
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,080
You do you.

154
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,720
Well, she really likes you, too.

155
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,080
And that is very rare for her.

156
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,770
Oh, look who's talking.

157
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,760
How's the crowd in here tonight?

158
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,680
Over there, big boy.

159
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,440
Oh, B.

160
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,600
Ladies like dumplings?

161
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,920
We just had the greatest dumplings.

162
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,080
Pete, meet my sister.

163
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,000
This is Pete, Claudia's brother.

164
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,800
Nice to meet you.

165
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,400
And Ben.

166
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Ben.

167
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,320
This is Ben.

168
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,400
We all grew up together.

169
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,440
Hey.

170
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,280
Yeah.

171
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,360
You two know each other?

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,720
Yeah, we met.

173
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,720
Barely.

174
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,360
Wow, that's so random.

175
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,880
I'm going to go grab a drink.

176
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,000
Door's that way if you're 
looking to sneak out.

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
I know that's your thing.

178
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,360
Well, I am a disaster.

179
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,360
Let's go away from this.

180
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,720
Yeah.

181
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,960
So you a lawyer yet?

182
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,880
Why?

183
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,400
Do you need a defense attorney?

184
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm just curious how you 
passed the class on ethics

185
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,800
and not bailing on people.

186
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,160
I think that's the jerk 
who B got with when she was

187
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,360
on her break from Jonathan.

188
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,760
No way.

189
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
So B's the coffee girl who ghosted him?

190
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,280
I thought she looked familiar, 
but I don't see faces.

191
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
I just see souls.

192
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,560
At least he made her realize 
that Jonathan was the one.

193
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,480
I'm engaged now.

194
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,320
Good for you.

195
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,000
Where are you registered?

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,960
I'll buy you a broomstick.

197
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,480
I'll send you an invite.

198
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,600
You still live at 28 Fuckboy Lane?

199
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,680
You do remember.

200
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,160
See, it did mean something to you.

201
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,200
You'll always be my rock bottom.

202
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,280
The night I spent with a bitch.

203
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,960
Did she just call him a bitch?

204
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,760
You think they're going to physically fight?

205
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,520
Or fuck?

206
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,000
That's a fine line.

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,040
Let's just get through tonight for them, OK?

208
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,120
Elle, she's your sister.

209
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,880
I'm sure the relationship won't last long.

210
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,000
She's your friend.

211
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,800
I question why they're even together.

212
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,760
Then I'm going to get a drink and toast to never

213
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,120
seeing you again.

214
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,760
Cheers to that, bro.

215
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,590
ANYONE BUT YOU

216
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,880
So before I pronounce this newlywed couple,

217
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,720
if anyone has an issue 
with these two wonderful people

218
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,040
joining together in holy matrimony,

219
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,380
speak now or forever hold your peace.

220
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,880
I have an objection.

221
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,000
Leo, don't do this.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,880
I have to, Annie.

223
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,400
It's just not right.

224
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,660
There's no way I can bless this union

225
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,000
without their friends and family joining us

226
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,960
to celebrate in Australia.

227
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,370
We're getting married in Sydney.

228
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,160
Welcome on board.

229
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,160
2K to the front.

230
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,480
Thank you, Sheryl.

231
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
51E, how long's the flight?

232
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,400
16 hours.

233
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,140
51F, thanks.

234
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,640
73F, all the way to the back.

235
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,740
Hey.

236
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,100
Head of the wedding?

237
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,840
Of my sister, yes, I am.

238
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,880
How crazy is it that we're on the same plane?

239
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,160
Don't think there's thousands of flights

240
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,280
flying to Sydney every day.

241
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,480
Oh, there's quite a few, actually.

242
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,640
Qantas, American, Qantas through Dubai, 
some co-chairs.

243
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,880
Serendipity, I guess.

244
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't think that word means 
what you think it means.

245
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So where's your fiance?

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,880
Wait, is this him?

247
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,760
Hey, I'm Ben.

248
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,720
I was her hall pass on your break.

249
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,600
What?

250
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
Oh my god, I forgot.

251
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,040
Claude told me you dumped him.

252
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,960
Did you sneak out on your wedding day?

253
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,680
Wow, you are a child.

254
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,480
It's a pretty long flight.

255
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,520
Do you want anything from the front of the boat?

256
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,200
Hot cookie, eye mask, pajamas, 
last 10 years of your life?

257
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,320
No, thank you.

258
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm all good on creatine 
and smell like insecurity.

259
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,590
Nothing small about me.

260
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,530
What the fuck?

261
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,620
Have a good flight.

262
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,680
See you there.

263
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,200
Why do so many of us feel stuck?

264
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,320
How is it even a very successful?

265
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
Often feel like there is something

266
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,760
missing from their lives.

267
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,080
Why do so many people spend years

268
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,080
mystically thinking about choices 
they might have made?

269
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,760
One answer to that problem, many of us

270
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,560
are leading lives that are misaligned

271
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,210
with our own deepest values and preferences.

272
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,480
Thank you so much for joining 
me today on Hidden Brain.

273
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,720
What psychology can teach us about living

274
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,240
our most authentic lives?

275
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,190
What the fuck?

276
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,160
Hey, Vinny!

277
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,830
Vindale!

278
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,630
OK, Vin, looking good.

279
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
Thanks for picking me up, dude.

280
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,160
Not just you, my guy.

281
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
Spelling Bee!

282
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Hey!

283
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,680
Our sisters are getting married.

284
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
How dope is that?

285
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I know, I'm so excited.

286
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Oh, great.

287
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,160
All right, let's hit it.

288
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Bye.

289
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Y'all ready for Australia?

290
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,160
Can't wait for y'all to see where we stay.

291
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,580
And the plan is so dope.

292
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,160
We're all staying at the same place?

293
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,160
Yep, my stepdad's house.

294
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Super important for them to 
keep the wedding party together.

295
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Sounds like a piece of information 
that could have been shared a little earlier.

296
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Well, that's because they think 
you guys hate each other,

297
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,580
so they didn't want to poke the beard.

298
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,160
Not bad, right?

299
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
You don't even play tennis.

300
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
I know, but I feel sweet.

301
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,160
Hey, meet Kalonabee, y'all.

302
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Meet Kalonabee.

303
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Hey, meet Kalonabee.

304
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
All over.

305
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
All over.

306
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
Spin, spin, spin.

307
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Woo-hoo!

308
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
He was the only member of the 
family who was trans.

309
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Yeah, he was there.

310
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,840
Whoa.

311
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
You're right.

312
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
This place is insane.

313
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,680
I know.

314
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,160
All right, let's get some sand under your feet.

315
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,340
Have you guys made up?

316
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,340
All good.

317
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,160
We're fine if he just stays away from me.

318
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Don't need an invitation for that.

319
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,930
I think you do if you're like this.

320
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,960
You can't leave me alone.

321
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,240
Same reason I slowed down at the car crash.

322
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,160
Okay, so you guys buried the hatchet,

323
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,240
water under the bridge, two adults adulting

324
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,500
like fucking adults.

325
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Oh, we did have a little bit

326
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,120
of a last minute snafu though.

327
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,200
You guys are gonna have to share a room.

328
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,220
There's only one bed,

329
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,920
but we hung a shower curtain in the middle.

330
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,260
She's kidding.

331
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,530
You're funny.

332
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,970
I can't wait any longer.

333
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,200
Wait for me!

334
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,300
Hallie's such a goof.

335
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,600
She's good for you.

336
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,100
She could use some spontaneity.

337
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,670
Hey, this weekend is gonna be perfect.

338
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,730
I hope so.

339
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,120
I have a million contingencies

340
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,160
and scenarios for everything.

341
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,800
And honestly, I just want this 
wedding to be beautiful

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,360
because I love the shit out of her

343
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,800
and I just wanna marry the bitch, 
you know what I'm saying?

344
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,340
You're such a romantic.

345
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,400
Hey, don't be mad at me, but Margaret's here.

346
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,010
Why would I be mad?

347
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,200
She lives here, I was 
100% expecting to see her.

348
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,360
Yeah.

349
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,680
Margaret, Margaret, look who's here.

350
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,840
There she is.

351
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,380
100%.

352
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,220
Go rip off the band-aid.

353
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,440
Babe!

354
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,480
How's it going, stranger?

355
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,480
I was hoping you'd come.

356
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,320
I wanted to message you,

357
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,520
but I didn't know how you'd feel 
about hearing from me.

358
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,420
Are you kidding?

359
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,280
I'm never leaving.

360
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,360
Never leave.

361
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,840
How are mom and dad?

362
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,760
They're good.

363
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,760
You know, mom now thinks she's Australian

364
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,240
and dad's not at all pointing out

365
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
every tiny little detail that's different.

366
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
They're also a little worried

367
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,200
how you're gonna react to all this.

368
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,560
What are you talking about?

369
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,520
Well, you know, everybody thought

370
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,280
that you'd be the one getting married first.

371
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,880
You always used to talk about 
your wedding growing up.

372
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,560
You used the toilet paper as a wedding dress

373
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,440
when I just used it to dress 
like a mummy, you know?

374
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,800
Hallie, stop.

375
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,160
That's not me anymore.

376
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,320
I'm free now.

377
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm deprogrammed.

378
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,160
That does not mean I don't support you

379
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,760
and your misguided view that soulmates exist.

380
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,280
That's sweet.

381
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,600
Is that gonna be your toast?

382
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,600
You and Claudia are the exception.

383
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm really happy for you, for real.

384
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,960
What's going on over there?

385
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,200
That's Claudia's cousin.

386
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,070
She visited the States a few years back.

387
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,320
They dated.

388
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,160
No biggie.

389
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,000
Broke up with him.

390
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,840
Crushed his heart.

391
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:31,800
No way, that man does not have a heart.

392
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,400
Feels like forever ago.

393
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,900
We were babies.

394
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,530
I'm really happy you're here.

395
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,870
We can reconnect as maybe not babies.

396
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,270
I would love that.

397
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,720
Beau!

398
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,760
Come eat my mate.

399
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,880
Ben, this is my partner, Beau.

400
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,720
Hi, mate.

401
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,480
Like, tennis partner?

402
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,320
Sometimes after.

403
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,200
How do you two dags know each other?

404
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,140
We had a bit of a go back when, didn't we?

405
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,960
Did you now?

406
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,910
Good on ya.

407
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,360
Hey, we're gonna go trotting this weekend.

408
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,680
Hit up the turps out here, eh?

409
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,840
It's gonna be a cracker.

410
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,840
Woo!

411
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,210
You know it.

412
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,000
Great guy.

413
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,840
Yeah.

414
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,610
Mommy!

415
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,040
Hey, Beatrice.

416
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,400
- Dad!  - You made it.

417
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,320
Oh, baby.

418
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,160
Hi, baby.

419
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,600
Hi, honey.

420
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,520
Oh, my God.

421
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,600
Wow.

422
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,440
How's our future lawyer?

423
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,280
Great.

424
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,200
Great.

425
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,040
How's the trip been?

426
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,600
Oh, magical.

427
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,960
The Australians are all wonderful.

428
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,440
And excuse me, but good looking.

429
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:01,880
Oh.

430
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,480
Why are they so weird about their plugs?

431
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,640
I mean, this place is basically America.

432
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,920
They speak English, they eat regular food,

433
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,560
they have a complicated relationship with their past.

434
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,920
How are you doing, honey?

435
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,760
I'm doing okay.

436
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,040
I'm doing great.

437
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,900
My big sister's getting married.

438
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,560
Could have been you.

439
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,920
Could still be you someday.

440
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,040
Have you heard from Jonathan?

441
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,880
Did he call or anything?

442
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,000
Well, that didn't take long.

443
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,480
We're just torn up that he's not part

444
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,560
of our family anymore.

445
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,600
I mean, he works at our house every night

446
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,240
from like 11 years old.

447
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,760
He was basically family.

448
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,560
Was about to be actual family.

449
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,920
If I never ask you for anything ever again,

450
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,710
can you please just lay off of me this weekend?

451
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,680
I just want both of our daughters to be happy.

452
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,120
I'm very happy, but not when you guys do this.

453
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,320
Ned, you in the right direction?

454
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,160
He's such a great guy.

455
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,600
Just think on it, yeah?

456
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,460
Bee, dinner at 7.30, okay?

457
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,520
Yeah.

458
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,400
Yeah.

459
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,680
Ben, all set for dinner, yeah?

460
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,800
Yeah, I'll be there.

461
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,280
I was plagiarizing.

462
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,120
Hey!

463
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,960
Hi Ben!

464
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,800
Hey Ben!

465
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,640
Hey, hey, hey.

466
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,480
Hey, hey, hey.

467
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,320
Everybody?

468
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,200
Dad's speech.

469
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,040
Oh yes, right, okay.

470
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,440
We're gonna make this short,

471
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,880
because you've all traveled a bloody long distance,

472
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,120
and Carol and I are so appreciative.

473
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,000
Biggest thing we've missed since coming back

474
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,320
from the States is not seeing our kids.

475
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,910
And you lot, our extended family,

476
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,160
so we're just over the moon to have a full house

477
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,760
before the wedding on Sunday.

478
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,070
Where we will celebrate Hallie and Claudia,

479
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,140
setting off on this crazy thing called life.

480
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,680
And of course, Innie and Leo, 
our new family.

481
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,600
Well, we're just so grateful,

482
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,080
not only for your incredible hospitality,

483
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,080
but for bringing into the world 
your beautiful daughter.

484
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,290
So as they say in our country, abondanza.

485
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,220
Cheers!

486
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,740
Now baby.

487
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,390
Wow!

488
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,600
What classes are you loving?

489
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,910
Have you given any more thought to tort law?

490
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,600
'Cause class action is really 
where it's at right now.

491
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,520
What does Jonathan say?

492
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,360
He knows you pretty well.

493
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,600
What does he think you should do?

494
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,440
Mom.

495
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,280
Okay.

496
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,000
I can't even remember why we 
put you in the truck again.

497
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,040
We didn't put her in the trunk,

498
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,200
she stowed away in the trunk.

499
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,360
Yeah, I wanted to go with 
you guys to see Cinderella.

500
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,760
We were going to Coachella.

501
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,960
I know that now, it was nice.

502
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,520
All right, everyone.

503
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,420
So Sage is meant to cleanse negative energy.

504
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,920
Let's just have a moment to calm ourselves.

505
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,680
I am not looking at anybody in particular,

506
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,680
but I am looking at you, Bee, and you, Ben.

507
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,280
Crown chakra.

508
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,300
Let's hit that cobra.

509
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,240
Cleanse, get that weasel.

510
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,080
Okay.

511
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,920
Go!

512
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,030
You go, you go.

513
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,000
Sign of the times.

514
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,920
All right, all right, four words.

515
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,240
First word, the, A, of, if.

516
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,280
Animosity, hate, liar.

517
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,120
Five words.

518
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,080
No, just shut the fuck up.

519
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,280
The Bible.

520
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,080
A woman, a woman, a woman who uses her sexuality

521
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,000
to take advantage of other people.

522
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,320
Mom, focus, okay?

523
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
Right here, right here.

524
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,320
This is a white people's game.

525
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,240
Y'all spend so much time 
trying to trick each other.

526
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,600
Y'all got so much time on your hands.

527
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,680
Just say the word.

528
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
It's on the extreme.

529
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,520
Grumpy old man.

530
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,360
Hi.

531
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,200
Hi.

532
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Okay, okay, yeah, okay.

533
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,520
Fuck boy.

534
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,640
Old cat woman.

535
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,480
Your ego.

536
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,640
Okay.

537
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,560
What is this?

538
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,400
Wait, no props.

539
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
No one cares, no one can see us.

540
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,720
Cheaters are shocking.

541
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,280
Says the woman who cheated on her fiance.

542
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,600
We were on a break, asshole.

543
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,770
You're either broken up for good, 
or you're cheating.

544
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,640
Either way, someone's lying to someone.

545
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,640
I must have really gotten under your skin.

546
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,520
Roger, what is this?

547
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,360
Fat, five.

548
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,670
What is the thing I'm holding in my hand?

549
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,350
Fireworks.

550
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,440
Fireworks by Katy Perry.

551
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,280
Hey.

552
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,260
That is not fair.

553
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Hey, what, you're not fair.

554
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
What's wrong with you?

555
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,440
Just stop.

556
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,280
What are you doing?

557
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,120
What is wrong with you?

558
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,960
Stop.

559
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,800
Oh God.

560
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,200
Oh God.

561
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,040
Sam, what the?

562
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,040
Oh my God.

563
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,080
Ali.

564
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,360
Get back.

565
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,200
Sam.

566
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,040
Roger.

567
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,360
I've got this.

568
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,790
That's some gangster shit right there.

569
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,400
Sorry.

570
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,240
Sorry.

571
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,640
They're going to ruin our wedding.

572
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
All that matters is that we're together.

573
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
It's true.

574
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,440
Look baby, I love you to the moon and back,

575
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:53,680
but those two fuckwads are 
going to destroy our weekend,

576
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,760
and our memories, 
which we are going to have

577
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,520
for a very long time, are headed 
straight over a cliff.

578
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,970
It's going to be fine baby, we just have to.

579
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,160
to stand there and profess our love.

580
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:05,580
It seems to me, their animus only surfaced

581
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,680
after they spent a night together.

582
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,680
Am I accurate?

583
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,120
That's usually how it goes, honey.

584
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,800
We crumple our feelings into a ball

585
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,280
and shove 'em deep down so we 
can enjoy a bit of frisk.

586
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,720
The solution appears to be simple then.

587
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,880
We return them to the night they were spent.

588
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:23,320
Like we trick them into falling 
in love with each other?

589
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,160
He didn't say anything about love, honey.

590
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,760
We just need to get them to 
jump each other's bones.

591
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,300
Yeah, come on!

592
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,880
That was good, right?

593
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,040
That was good.

594
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,880
You go, you go, you go, you go, you go.

595
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,560
She clearly has eyes for men.

596
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,760
Who does, father?

597
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,200
Hallie Spence, the sister.

598
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,520
The plump-chested one with the sad eyes.

599
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,720
You can't say that.

600
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,760
What the hell?

601
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

602
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
No, that was rude.

603
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,040
I apologize to anyone that was listening,

604
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
which can only be you, Pete,

605
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,880
'cause you're the only person that was listening.

606
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,840
I apologize.

607
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,320
I accept your apology and will now move on.

608
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,880
Do you know Bea's been in love with Ben

609
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,600
since the first night they met?

610
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,240
Well, why didn't she tell him?

611
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,480
You know, when I was a young 
bloke and I liked a girl,

612
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,560
I would sneak up behind her 
and I'd cut a lock of her hair

613
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,360
and then I'd smack her on the bum!

614
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,200
What the hell?

615
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,560
I don't know, I'm not good at this, sorry.

616
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,280
Bea was just too scared to tell him,

617
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,920
but I've talked to her 
and she says she regrets

618
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,200
walking out that morning.

619
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,400
Tell me more, son.

620
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
Why me?

621
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,760
Because you're really good at it, right?

622
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,600
You can do it.

623
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,440
Why me, why?

624
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,280
Why you put this hat on me?

625
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,000
No one can see me, it's a 
radio play, motherfucker.

626
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Bea wants us to tell him 
how much she likes him,

627
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,920
so he lets his guard down and goes to her.

628
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,760
Some Cupid's killed with 
arrows and some with traps.

629
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,720
That was good, I like that, that's good.

630
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,560
I just made it up.

631
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,280
So, he needs to go to her, drop his drawers,

632
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,080
and say, "Come to Papa."

633
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,080
What are you doing?

634
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,680
I'm from a different generation.

635
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,720
And your generation sucks.

636
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,040
You fucked up the whole world for us.

637
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,920
And I'm full of shame.

638
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,160
But the bottom line, Bea likes Ben.

639
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:01,240
But Ben feels awful that 
he called her a disaster.

640
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,800
I mean, he said it was his fragile male ego.

641
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,680
Then why is he fighting with her?

642
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,480
Well, because he likes her.

643
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,400
And I know that Bea likes Ben.

644
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,560
She's just denying herself 
because she's got in her head

645
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,800
somehow that she'll never love again.

646
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,960
Whoa, I'm not talking about love, baby.

647
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,720
I'm talking about dick.

648
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,560
Oh, it's Ben.

649
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,400
Oh.

650
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,160
Hey.

651
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,000
You.

652
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,760
Oh God, they got to you too?

653
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,600
What?

654
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,960
Did you just overhear Holly and Claudia

655
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,120
say how much I like you?

656
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,910
No.

657
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,220
Really?

658
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,720
It was Pete and Roger.

659
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,480
Fantastic, it's a team effort.

660
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,880
They're trying to get us together.

661
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,320
No way.

662
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,160
Come here.

663
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,560
Oh, maybe they want us to 
stop acting like assholes

664
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,640
so we don't ruin the 
biggest event of their lives.

665
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
Us?

666
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,840
There is no us and assholes.

667
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,600
You're the one who destroyed 
the living room.

668
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800
Would you two mind helping 
me with something?

669
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,390
I hate to ask, but 
I'd really appreciate it.

670
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,760
Sure.

671
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Yeah.

672
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:32,680
So Roger left his sunglasses 
on the sailboat.

673
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,800
I swear, if his head wasn't screwed on,

674
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,200
we'd use it as a bowling ball.

675
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,880
Do me a favor and swim out and get them.

676
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,400
It's the one on the right.

677
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,240
Both of us.

678
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,800
Is that really a two person job?

679
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,240
Doesn't seem like it.

680
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,080
You two.

681
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,360
Yeah.

682
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,760
All right, so everyone's involved in this.

683
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,600
I know.

684
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,170
I feel bad.

685
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,040
Me too.

686
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,960
I don't want to bum Holly and Claudia out.

687
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,770
Just me and you.

688
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,160
Can you not swim?

689
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,240
I'm an excellent swimmer.

690
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,600
Why are you so out of breath?

691
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm fine.

692
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:13,520
How much further do you think?

693
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,960
Are your eyes closed?

694
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,480
I think it's dark.

695
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,840
Why are you so out of shape?

696
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,960
You have like a 10 pop.

697
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,920
I'm not out of shape.

698
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,120
I've been to 295, 300 once.

699
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,400
I just don't do cardio.

700
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,700
Oh my God, you're hot girl fit.

701
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,160
I'm not hot girl fit.

702
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,690
Okay, my bad.

703
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,550
We'll see you at the boat.

704
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,800
Wait, wait, wait.

705
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,560
I could have done it myself, but whatever.

706
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,400
Thanks.

707
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,960
No fucking way.

708
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,600
Honey, look who's here.

709
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,040
I cannot believe they did this.

710
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,880
Who is that?

711
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,360
That is my ex, Jonathan.

712
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,200
Hey, hey.

713
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,120
What is he doing here?

714
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,000
My Black Hawk helicopter parents

715
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,400
have been trying to get us back together

716
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,680
for the past four months.

717
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,400
They flew him halfway across the world

718
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,720
to your sister's wedding?

719
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,760
That's some deep off shit.

720
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,890
They came to play.

721
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,320
That's my parents.

722
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,480
They think I'm throwing my life away.

723
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,240
Honey, we're just gonna take him back

724
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,840
and get him all settled in.

725
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,880
I'll see you later.

726
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,880
You know, maybe we should do it.

727
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,480
Just tell everyone we're together.

728
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,320
What?

729
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,400
It would solve that problem for me

730
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,680
and that problem for you.

731
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,440
I don't have a problem.

732
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,040
You clearly want Margaret.

733
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,880
No, I don't.

734
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,720
Yes, you do.

735
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,120
I saw the way you looked at her last night

736
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,760
and I know she broke your heart.

737
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,280
She sees you're with me.

738
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,560
She wants what she can't have

739
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,680
and then bye bye crocodile Jack.

740
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,920
Fuck, he's fast.

741
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,440
Making her jealous is not gonna work.

742
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,680
We're not in seventh grade.

743
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,800
Trust me, bro.

744
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,120
We're all in seventh grade 
when it comes to this stuff.

745
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,880
They've already gone through 
all of the bullshit

746
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,680
trying to trick us into each other's arms.

747
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,000
Let's just embrace it.

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,640
There's no way we can convince anyone

749
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,040
we actually like each other.

750
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,480
Yeah, you're right.

751
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,320
I know.

752
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,200
You know, I still think about 
that night we spent together.

753
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,040
Shut up.

754
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,280
No, I'm serious.

755
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,080
You know, this could be kind of fun.

756
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,560
We're at a wedding a million 
miles away from home.

757
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,920
Who knows what could happen under 
the cover of a masquerade.

758
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,080
And that night at your place,

759
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,560
no matter how it ended, 
it was still pretty amazing.

760
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,480
Convincing enough?

761
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,820
Fuck it.

762
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,480
Let's do it.

763
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,440
Just wait.

764
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,160
Wait.

765
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,960
Okay, okay.

766
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,600
Whoever wants to go on the hike, 
we need to leave now.

767
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,760
We're running behind schedule.

768
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,600
Wait, wait, wait.

769
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,240
Babe, the mountains have been 
there for millions of years.

770
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
A few more minutes isn't gonna hurt them.

771
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,080
Baby, I know you are trying 
to calm me down

772
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,000
and I love you for it.

773
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,840
Thank you.

774
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,120
But I am hurting cats right now

775
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,960
and I need some help

776
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,120
instead of this easy 
breezy Martin Scorsese.

777
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,080
Aw, jitters.

778
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,680
Remember our wedding?

779
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,600
Only that you're the 
most beautiful bride

780
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,760
on God's green earth.

781
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,960
Right answer.

782
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,840
We're coming, we're coming, 
we're coming.

783
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,120
Jinx, you owe me a cup.

784
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,400
Oh, you have a little 
something in your teeth.

785
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,240
Oh, no, wait, get it, get it, get it.

786
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,840
Yeah, let me just take that out.

787
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,040
Oh, I gotta get it out.

788
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,880
Oh, it's right there.

789
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,480
Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it.

790
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,150
Honey, here he is.

791
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,760
Hey.

792
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,480
Jonathan.

793
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,600
So nice to see you.

794
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,280
I had no idea you were coming.

795
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,720
So your parents didn't tell you, okay?

796
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,880
Yeah, you know, the first thing 
I asked them

797
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,440
when they invited me was, 
"Does B know?"

798
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,000
'Cause otherwise this would be 
really fucking awkward.

799
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,280
And now it is fucking awkward.

800
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,840
No, no, not at all.

801
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,680
I'm in a lot of love.

802
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,520
No, you're like family.

803
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,840
It'd be effing awkward if you weren't here.

804
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,960
I'm so glad you're here.

805
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,360
I'm so happy for you two.

806
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,360
Hey, congratulations.

807
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,200
Yeah, thanks.

808
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,400
Right?

809
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,330
It's great to see you.

810
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,520
It's great to see you too.

811
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,680
We're all going on a hike,

812
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,120
so whoever wants to come with, 
we gotta move out.

813
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,640
Let's move out.

814
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,720
Ben, meet Jonathan.

815
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,560
Oh, hey, man.

816
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,400
I'm Ben.

817
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,040
Hey, oh, Pete and Claudia's friend, right?

818
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,900
Also friends with Bea, among other things.

819
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,000
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.

820
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,740
Okay, plenty of enough time in the
 car to do whatever the fuck this is.

821
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,000
Come on, let's go!

822
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,000
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

823
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
We need to come up with a game plan.

824
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Yeah, you are so terrible at this.

825
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
What?

826
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,000
We're doing this thing!

827
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Honey, I'm sorry.

828
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I know we should have asked you, 
but we had to invite you.

829
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,000
Oh, it's totally fine. 
I'm glad he's here.

830
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I love him and Holly loves him.

831
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Really?

832
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Yeah.

833
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,430
Great, okay. So we're spending a little 
time together away from the real world

834
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,000
and see if you rekindle, re-spark, re-bark.

835
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh, no, Mom, guys, no.

836
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,410
I totally forgot to tell you, 
but I'm with Ben.

837
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,350
Do you want to come?

838
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,300
I think I'm going to hang back 
and yell at your parents.

839
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Have fun.

840
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,620
Alright, so is it like we just got 
together or we've been sneaking around?

841
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:18,620
Oh, I got it. What if we ran into 
each other at Chipotle,

842
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,000
lady in the tramp, the burrito?

843
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,560
No.

844
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,000
This can't be that hard.

845
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's harder than you think. 
My parents don't even believe it yet.

846
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
You told them five seconds ago.

847
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
They know I would never go 
out with a guy like you.

848
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,210
You've been with one 
guy your entire life.

849
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,550
Jonathan's a better man 
than you'll ever be.

850
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,000
And yet you left him.

851
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Which is why exactly? 
Because he seems like he checks all your boxes.

852
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,740
Okay, you don't know my boxes 
and you never will.

853
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,000
Just figure this out, please.

854
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Okay.

855
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:46,000
We just suck face in front of everybody.

856
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Half of them think they set us up anyway.

857
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
No, that's too much. We need to 
do something that's more hidden

858
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,000
so it feels more real, not some 
fuckboy wedding hookup.

859
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,760
You're calling me a fuckboy 
like it's an insult?

860
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I own that shit.

861
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Let's just be affectionate.

862
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,260
I know it's a foreign concept for you.

863
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:03,000
I can be affectionate.

864
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I'll affectionate the shit out of you.

865
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
I can't believe your 
parents invited Jonathan.

866
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Now I have to find a table to sit him at.

867
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
What about Bea?

868
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
No, no, she's fine. 
She's sitting with us at our table.

869
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
No, I'm talking about how she's already at a 
low point because she's going through a breakup

870
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,580
and I don't even know 
what's happening with school.

871
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,000
She never even talks about it anymore.

872
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I guess I could put up with the cousins.

873
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,170
Why?

874
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:25,600
You alright?

875
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh, shit.

876
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Wow.

877
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Check it out, guys!

878
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Nice!

879
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Yeah!

880
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Beautiful!

881
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
See, I told you it was going to be good.

882
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Man, that's nice.

883
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, wow.

884
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Wow.

885
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,000
So beautiful.

886
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There it is.

887
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Feel the serenity.

888
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,630
Pretty spectacular, hey?

889
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,000
It's amazing.

890
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Alright, your turn.

891
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,000
Wow.

892
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
This is just so romantic.

893
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,000
Okay, nuzzle my neck.

894
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,180
Okay.

895
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:01,000
Get in there.

896
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Damn, you are short.

897
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
You are not tall enough to say that.

898
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Oh.

899
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Oh, are you ticklish?

900
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,410
No, I'm acting.

901
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Like a toddler?

902
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,000
No, go away.

903
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Okay, I can use that.

904
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Beg me.

905
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Beg me to stuff you in the butt.

906
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,070
Stop!

907
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Just let me do it.

908
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,000
Permission to put my left hand 
on your right buttock.

909
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,000
Granted.

910
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Too hard.

911
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Sorry.

912
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You gotta sell it.

913
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Okay, not in circles.

914
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
It's not a magic lamp.

915
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
What?

916
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,460
Okay, now you're just playing bop it.

917
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,000
I've never rubbed a bopper show.

918
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,690
Clearly, you've tried.

919
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,000
Are you not wearing underwear?

920
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
It's a swimsuit.

921
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I'm on holiday.

922
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,450
Oh.

923
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Okay, just mind the gap.

924
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
How's that?

925
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That's good.

926
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Just like, but you don't have to hover.

927
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Just kind of, oh, man the woods.

928
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,260
I'm sorry.

929
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,180
Okay, just take it out.

930
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,000
You try.

931
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You want me to stick my finger in my own ass?

932
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
How's that gonna convince?

933
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, on you.

934
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
I can't.

935
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Jesus Christ, it's like a vacuum pack down here.

936
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
How'd you get in this thing?

937
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, man, it's tight.

938
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Oh, see, it's like holding a baby bird.

939
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:31,300
God damn it.

940
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,760
Were they not watching this whole time?

941
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You like a mole or something on your butt?

942
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
No.

943
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Really? 'Cause I feel something.

944
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I don't have a mole.

945
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
What the fuck?

946
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
What the fuck?

947
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
What the fuck?

948
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
What the fuck?

949
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What the fuck?

950
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Are there any more on me?

951
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I don't know.

952
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Jack, spiders hunt bears.

953
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
They hunt bears.

954
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,000
No pictures.

955
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Put the cameras down.

956
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
We're not gonna take a spirit.

957
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Are there any more?

958
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I don't know.

959
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Where are they?

960
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I feel it.

961
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I feel it.

962
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I think I see something.

963
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
What do you see?

964
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
What do you see?

965
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Oh, no, that's just a part of you.

966
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
You're fine.

967
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,600
All right, look, if I have one of 
those little fuckers in me,

968
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:19,630
they might be in you.

969
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,240
I'm good.

970
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:26,000
That's probably a better way to 
check than what I did.

971
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Yeah.

972
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,000
All right, little one, 
we join your journey.

973
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
We do not inherit the earth.

974
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,130
We just borrow it from our creatures.

975
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,460
Hey, guys.

976
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,440
What did we miss?

977
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,760
Wow.

978
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,620
Why can't I get this?

979
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,490
Because you're meant to learn 
to dive when you're six.

980
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,670
You got this, hon.

981
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,800
You ever try focusing on your toes?

982
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,500
My mom taught me this trick.

983
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:11,000
If you pretend like there's a 
string from your nose to your toes,

984
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,550
you just kind of maintain that position.

985
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,810
You mind doing it again?

986
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,830
This time I'm going to shout out 
a tribute question.

987
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,460
I think it's just going to 
help clear your mind.

988
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,860
Just make sure it's a 
question about airplanes

989
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:24,000
or the assassination of 
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

990
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,080
Okay, um, uh, what company 
created the Concorde?

991
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:33,000
A collaboration between British Airways 
and the French government.

992
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,880
How'd I do?

993
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:36,650
You're good there.

994
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:40,000
Maybe your mom can teach him how to dive.

995
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,260
She passed away.

996
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

997
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Yeah, sorry.

998
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
All right, I'm going to go again,

999
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,270
but this time give me one with 
a little shorter answer.

1000
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,000
I have a better idea.

1001
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,470
You just let me do everything, 
I'll guide you in.

1002
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,180
Don't think.

1003
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,000
Be careful of his shoulder.

1004
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Yeah, I wrecked it jumping off 
a moving train in Paris.

1005
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,420
Wouldn't let me see the Eiffel Tower alone.

1006
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,000
I had to tell her I love her.

1007
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
When you know she's the one, 
nothing else matters.

1008
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,110
I'm waving, thank you, thank you.

1009
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,000
There you go.

1010
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,370
Did I do it?

1011
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

1012
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Yeah.

1013
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,320
Good job, babe.

1014
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,000
Your dad's a natural.

1015
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,590
I'm so glad you guys got to 
spend some time with Ben.

1016
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,210
Are you two really getting to 
know each other in a very respectful manner?

1017
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,000
One befitting such a kind and 
intelligent woman as your daughter.

1018
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,310
Yes, we are in the early stages.

1019
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:42,190
Not too early.

1020
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,810
But also not so advanced.

1021
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,780
Just that magical moment when two people 
come together in this crazy journey we call life.

1022
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:50,340
That's why I was so worried 
when Jonathan showed up.

1023
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,000
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

1024
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I even suggested we hide our light 
under a bushel for his sake.

1025
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,870
But our love is just so strong.

1026
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:59,810
And I know what you guys are thinking.

1027
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,000
He's much older.

1028
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,590
They weren't, right?

1029
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,620
Probably thinking I'm 27, early 28s.

1030
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:11,470
Yes, we are very happy.

1031
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,490
Happiest.

1032
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,520
Yep.

1033
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
You know, you looked like that back in the day.

1034
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
No, I didn't.

1035
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
That guy's made out of cobblestone.

1036
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:26,000
They're holding hands.

1037
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I think it's working.

1038
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I can't believe these 
dumbasses were so easily fooled.

1039
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:35,000
Was that bullshit about your mom?

1040
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
What?

1041
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
The story about the giant wrench.

1042
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:41,000
I thought it might have been a lie 
until all your one night nothings.

1043
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,000
You ever heard that too?

1044
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,000
Like, I didn't mean...

1045
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,000
I'm sorry.

1046
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,000
And it wasn't a lie.

1047
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,460
Thanks for being so nice to my dad.

1048
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,520
You should probably rinse off.

1049
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:09,970
You have his SPF a billion on you now.

1050
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,300
Cheers, mate. I'll just grab a quickie.

1051
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:20,920
Okay.

1052
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,730
So, Australia.

1053
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,970
What do you reckon, eh?

1054
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
How you finding it?

1055
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,690
I don't know. It's great.

1056
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,210
Maz goes on about you all the time.

1057
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,970
Ripper Cunt, she calls you.

1058
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:37,000
Maz is Margaret, and Ripper Cunt is...

1059
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Good friend.

1060
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,910
Oh, yeah.

1061
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,740
You know you had a proper surf 
when sand gets all up your clacker.

1062
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,540
And your gobbler, too.

1063
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,000
Gobbler is...

1064
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,990
You know, your hog bonnet.

1065
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,220
You know, your beef cap.

1066
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,630
Come on, mate. You know, the anteater.

1067
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:00,490
Anyway, good to have ya.

1068
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:01,860
Gotcha.

1069
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,370
G'day, love.

1070
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,680
Hey, mate.

1071
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,280
Fancy a game?

1072
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
You're going down.

1073
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,760
How have you been doing?

1074
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
Pretty good.

1075
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,320
You?

1076
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,350
Okay, I guess.

1077
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:24,850
How's school going?

1078
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,320
Decide what kind of law 
you wanna practice yet?

1079
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,280
You know me.

1080
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,880
I've never been one for practicing.

1081
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,320
Still having second thoughts?

1082
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,320
Straight to third.

1083
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:36,680
I know it's weird, me being here,

1084
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,360
but believe me, I had nothing 
to do with it.

1085
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,320
Your parents duped me, gave me 
the freaking flyer miles.

1086
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,680
That's sweet.

1087
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,980
You're part of the family.

1088
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:49,060
I'd be lying if I said I haven't 
been thinking about you.

1089
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,160
Yeah, me too.

1090
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,080
How long have you and that guy, Ben, been?

1091
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,920
It's kind of new.

1092
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,880
Not like new, new, but newish.

1093
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,480
Well, I think he seems great.

1094
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:08,600
No, you don't.

1095
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,920
I really don't.

1096
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:14,280
Thanks for being so cool about all of this.

1097
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,200
Not just this, but this too.

1098
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,320
It's really good to see you, Bea.

1099
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,480
I'm glad you're here.

1100
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,120
Now let's have fun.

1101
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,040
Let's do it.

1102
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,840
Mate.

1103
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,400
That's me.

1104
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,000
You want a coffee?

1105
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,640
It's the best in the world.

1106
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,040
You guys are really proud 
of your coffee here.

1107
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:55,970
It's the best in the fucking world.

1108
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,840
Okay.

1109
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,160
Enjoy.

1110
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,120
Fuck, that is good.

1111
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,440
I was thinking of going for 
a bit of a run later.

1112
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,600
Do you want to join?

1113
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,440
I'm actually going on a 
bike ride with Bea,

1114
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,000
so I don't think I can.

1115
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,080
She's a little sweet on you, hey?

1116
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,200
Oh, you caught that.

1117
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,720
How long have you and Beau been together?

1118
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:23,160
Nah, we're just banging about.

1119
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,800
He's nice, but I think I'm looking

1120
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,560
for someone less casual.

1121
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,440
More romantic.

1122
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,280
Wow.

1123
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:33,760
Why did me and you ever break up anyway?

1124
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:35,960
I don't really remember,

1125
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,680
but I think you said something like

1126
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,300
I was an immature, drongo, 
smothered in ex body spray.

1127
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:49,000
Smells like you're not that guy anymore.

1128
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:49,960
Bea's a lucky girl.

1129
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,800
Oh.

1130
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,230
Hey, open the door.

1131
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:08,720
Bea.

1132
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,720
What's wrong?

1133
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,120
Margaret thinks we're together.

1134
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,040
That's great.

1135
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,560
No, Margaret needs to think

1136
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,840
we're the right type of together.

1137
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,120
Not together together, 
but like situationally together.

1138
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:20,440
'Cause if she thinks we're together together,

1139
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,800
she's not gonna break girl code.

1140
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,800
So we need to finesse our togetherness

1141
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,960
so that we're together,

1142
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,680
but there's an opening for our togetherness

1143
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,200
and she can just slide right in

1144
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,280
so that we can be together.

1145
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,360
Are you on Coke?

1146
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,200
No, it's like coffee here.

1147
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,160
It's like meth.

1148
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,480
I'm guessing.

1149
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,400
No, I'm not.

1150
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,440
I worked at Goldman.

1151
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,320
Partner's wedding.

1152
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,280
Do what you do.

1153
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,040
Jesus, dude, who are you?

1154
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,880
I'm a man trying to figure this out.

1155
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,400
Look at your room, it's so much bigger.

1156
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,720
You got a painting?

1157
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,480
Wow, that's so red.

1158
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,920
We have to kick it up a notch.

1159
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,480
Make it feel like we're in the Gaga stage.

1160
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,160
What do you wanna do, 
take me in the hallway?

1161
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,240
That is not Gaga.

1162
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,080
Actually, that could be construed as Gaga.

1163
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,080
Tonight's the rehearsal dinner,

1164
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,920
so we have to do something

1165
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,920
that makes it look like you're into me,

1166
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,160
but you're not into me.

1167
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,000
And I'm into you,

1168
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,200
but you can tell by my face 
that it's never gonna mount.

1169
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,000
Get it together, man.

1170
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,600
You hit me so much.

1171
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,840
Okay, Kalana,

1172
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:13,640
now pretend this is a real fox 
that messed up our garden.

1173
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,960
Fuck it up.

1174
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,560
Fuck it up, fuck it up, 
fuck it up, fuck it up.

1175
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,040
Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up.

1176
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,880
Fuck it up.

1177
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,720
Ooh.

1178
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,840
You see that?

1179
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,000
He did it, yeah.

1180
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,320
Oh, hey, they're here.

1181
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,960
All right, everybody, wheels up.

1182
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,800
Hustle up.

1183
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,640
Bad dog.

1184
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,480
You look cute.

1185
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,480
Baby, you look so good.

1186
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,480
She's has been.

1187
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,560
You look so good.

1188
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,880
Yeah, I look bad.

1189
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,200
Man, this is the best time to say that.

1190
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,520
Daddy's a dad.

1191
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,120
Come on, let's go.

1192
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,960
Yeah.

1193
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,000
All right, let's do it.

1194
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,800
Thank you.

1195
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:09,440
You see the size of that boat?

1196
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,520
Hey, guys.

1197
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,360
Woo!

1198
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,360
Nice touch.

1199
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,200
Nice dress.

1200
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,160
You have a good heart.

1201
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,480
I love this dress.

1202
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:57,320
You look fine.

1203
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,160
Oh, thank you.

1204
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,440
What would you like to drink?

1205
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,000
What's a traditional drink 
for a rehearsal dinner?

1206
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,080
Three scotches neat and a 
champagne for the lady.

1207
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,280
Oh, thank you.

1208
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,680
All right.

1209
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:07,800
You remembered.

1210
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,920
That you can't handle hard liquor?

1211
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:11,640
Yeah, the smell's still not out of my car.

1212
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,600
You know I feel really bad about that.

1213
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,520
That was a fun night.

1214
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,760
That was a fun summer.

1215
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,760
Marks!

1216
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,800
Marks, captain says that 
we can steer the ship.

1217
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,600
Oh, okay, I'm coming.

1218
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:28,960
Hang on, I've got heels on.

1219
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,520
Look how lucky we are.

1220
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,960
On a boat sailing back and forth

1221
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,720
with no real transportation or reason.

1222
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,760
Okay.

1223
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,560
And look at you, Polly Pocket.

1224
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:39,840
You the belle of the boat.

1225
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,360
He didn't remember me.

1226
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:50,860
Oh, hey, look, is that Tasmania?

1227
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:54,680
No, honey, that's, yes, 
I think it might be.

1228
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,560
Polly, Tasmania, God damn it.

1229
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,760
There it is.

1230
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,160
Well, at least that was subtle.

1231
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,240
Was it?

1232
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,720
This oddly reminds me of prom.

1233
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,720
The first or second time?

1234
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,560
Jonathan is just the most perfect guy.

1235
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,440
He's like a son to us.

1236
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,840
Well, that might be a problem, mate.

1237
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,920
They might not wanna shag a brother.

1238
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,240
So how's it going?

1239
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,680
Can parents back off a little?

1240
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,070
How about you?

1241
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,600
Game on.

1242
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,680
Can you even dance?

1243
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:53,840
You just let me lead.

1244
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:55,600
Oh, God.

1245
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:05,960
Let's go.

1246
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,240
Is Margaret watching?

1247
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,120
It's a little hard to tell

1248
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,360
what bitch Hemsworth am I wearing.

1249
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,760
Everybody to the top deck,

1250
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,320
we about to do a champagne toast.

1251
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,160
I'm with you.

1252
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,320
So what are we doing?

1253
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,320
Closing the deal.

1254
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,490
Titanic me.

1255
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:13,560
What?

1256
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:15,360
Oh, help yourself to some champagne.

1257
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:16,200
Oh, thank you.

1258
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,320
Grab some drinks.

1259
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:18,160
Oh, great.

1260
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,080
Nice.

1261
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,920
Titanic me.

1262
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,280
No, that is so lame.

1263
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,720
Exactly.

1264
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,920
The only people who would 
do something this lame

1265
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,920
are the ones who know how lame it is,

1266
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,600
but are in the first stages 
of liking each other,

1267
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,160
so they're totally comfortable 
in their mutual lameness.

1268
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:36,680
Toast me.

1269
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:37,680
Oh my God.

1270
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,520
Come on.

1271
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:39,480
This is so cringe.

1272
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,960
So is saying cringe, old man.

1273
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:51,280
Lift my arms.

1274
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,360
I've seen the movie.

1275
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,200
Have you?

1276
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:59,400
Okay.

1277
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:02,000
This is never gonna work.

1278
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,540
Aww! That is the cutest thing I've ever seen!

1279
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,000
Are they doing Titanic?

1280
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Aww!

1281
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:15,910
Are they watching?

1282
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,000
Yep.

1283
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Are they buying it?

1284
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Can't imagine they would.

1285
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:25,000
It's real. We did it.

1286
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,270
We're good. We're really bloody good.

1287
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:31,770
Jonathan, have you seen Tasmania?

1288
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:34,000
Inya, I'm fine. It's fine.

1289
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:45,740
Can I do the line?

1290
01:00:47,870 --> 01:00:50,250
That's king of the world. 
You're king of the world.

1291
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,420
Jack, I'm flying!

1292
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:55,000
Okay, we can stop there.

1293
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
We can stop there.

1294
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,000
They're gone. Show's over.

1295
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,660
Oh my god!

1296
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,000
No! Wait for me! Help! Wait!

1297
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Wait!

1298
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Bae!

1299
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Bea!

1300
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Are you okay?

1301
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Yeah.

1302
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:43,510
Why'd you jump in?

1303
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,530
To save you!

1304
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,950
But you're a terrible swimmer!

1305
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:48,970
I'm a great swimmer! Just short distances.

1306
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,460
We're gonna die.

1307
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,480
We're not gonna die.

1308
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,150
We're gonna get hypothermia.

1309
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,170
The water's 90 degrees.

1310
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,630
We're gonna get eaten by sharks.

1311
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,970
Fuck! We're gonna get eaten by sharks!

1312
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,180
We are gonna be fine.

1313
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,200
And we spent ten hours shredding 
water off the coast of the Cayman Islands.

1314
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:11,570
Goldman?

1315
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,020
Yeah, it was a partner's kids bar mitzvah.

1316
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:14,240
A little bit of crack.

1317
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,290
Oh my god!

1318
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,160
Roger!

1319
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,190
Oh my god!

1320
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,880
It looks like they're going full Titanic.

1321
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,380
I love the commitment!

1322
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,400
Stop the boat!

1323
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,430
No, no, no.

1324
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:27,450
Help!

1325
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:28,480
They're coming!

1326
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,500
Stay calm!

1327
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:30,120
This is not a very good swim.

1328
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:30,810
Bei!

1329
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:38,770
There.

1330
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:41,700
Are you sure?

1331
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:42,970
Yeah.

1332
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Come on.

1333
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,000
Why aren't we turning the boat around?

1334
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
We are in too shallow of water.

1335
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
We'll run aground.

1336
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
But harbour rescue has been notified.

1337
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Come on.

1338
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,000
Are you good?

1339
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Mm-hmm.

1340
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Okay.

1341
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:26,000
All right.

1342
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:27,910
Okay.

1343
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,000
Let's go.

1344
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
All right, get in the row.

1345
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Okay.

1346
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,460
That was, um, probably the most--

1347
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:40,000
I mean, if you didn't close 
it with Margaret, I don't--

1348
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:44,560
There's nothing more romantic 
than jumping in to save me.

1349
01:03:44,730 --> 01:03:47,000
Yeah, well, Jonathan didn't do it, 
that's for sure.

1350
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Your parents half the clock, 
that's shit.

1351
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
You didn't even give him a chance.

1352
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,000
Why do you keep defending this guy?

1353
01:03:54,710 --> 01:03:56,720
Why do you break up with him 
in the first place?

1354
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:57,740
It's complicated.

1355
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:58,770
It's never complicated.

1356
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:00,000
What, he cheated on you?

1357
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:01,350
Drug problem?

1358
01:04:01,970 --> 01:04:04,000
Did you catch him measuring his 
dick with a ruler app?

1359
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,000
We never fought.

1360
01:04:09,060 --> 01:04:10,000
Isn't that a good thing?

1361
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It was just comfortable.

1362
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,790
And he's a great guy, which means 
there's no one out there for me

1363
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:16,000
because I had the best one.

1364
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I couldn't even tell him 
I quit law school.

1365
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
And I have no idea what 
I'm gonna do with my life.

1366
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:27,000
We're gonna get eaten by sharks, 
I had to tell somebody.

1367
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
No one else knows?

1368
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I don't think this is the 
weekend to drop that bomb.

1369
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,000
You finally did it.

1370
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,000
What?

1371
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:40,000
You know, one night you said you 
didn't want to be a lawyer anyways.

1372
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,000
You remember that?

1373
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:47,000
It was a memorable night, 
until you snuck out, of course.

1374
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:51,000
Why did you?

1375
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,000
Because you scared the shit out of me.

1376
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:02,000
It was the first time in my life 
that I felt fire and I had to blow it out.

1377
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,000
I know a little bit about that.

1378
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,600
I was really hurt when you left.

1379
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:15,000
So I said all that terrible 
stuff about you to Pete.

1380
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,000
That's not how I felt.

1381
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,000
Look at us.

1382
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:30,000
Just a couple of fucked up people 
floating in the middle of the harbor.

1383
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:35,000
Promise me if we make it out 
alive we'll go see that from dry land.

1384
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
It's a pretty killer view from here.

1385
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's dumb but I want to see the people.

1386
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Landmarks like those are 
full of people in love.

1387
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,470
Marriage proposals, honeymooners, 
romantics jumping off of moving trains

1388
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:50,000
just to see the building 
with the person they love.

1389
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:53,000
Like your dad in the Eiffel Tower?

1390
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,000
He told you that?

1391
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,000
Nothing else matters when it comes to love.

1392
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,000
You could use a bit of that right now.

1393
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:06,000
It's not dumb.

1394
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,000
You, me and the opera house.

1395
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,840
It's a date.

1396
01:06:11,490 --> 01:06:12,000
I promise.

1397
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,000
What's wrong?

1398
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:14,000
I'm a little afraid of flying.

1399
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,560
Don't you fly all the time for your job?

1400
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:19,320
I have a very specific routine.

1401
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,300
I mask, headphones, build my bubble.

1402
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,000
That's my Serenity song.

1403
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,390
How do you know my Serenity song?

1404
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:40,410
Don't worry about it.

1405
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,000
You all good?

1406
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Shut the fuck up now!

1407
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,000
Thanks again.

1408
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,270
Stay out of the water, yeah?

1409
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Want some coffee?

1410
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Not the stuff from here. 
I'll be up all night.

1411
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:16,880
Yeah.

1412
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,000
Thanks for kind of saving me though.

1413
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:21,000
It was fun.

1414
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,000
Stupid, but fun.

1415
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Well, that's the best kind.

1416
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,000
No, no, no, it's hot!

1417
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:39,000
I'm warm.

1418
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
When are you ever gonna learn?

1419
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,000
Like, you want me to blow on it?

1420
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:55,000
Is it still hot?

1421
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,900
We're getting pretty good at faking it.

1422
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:47,000
I don't even know what's real anymore.

1423
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,370
Everything I do just feels like a mistake.

1424
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,690
Ben, Steve, are you guys all right?

1425
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,970
Ben, wait, you hear?

1426
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I can't hear you.

1427
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Steve!

1428
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Beatrice!

1429
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Beatrice!

1430
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:45,000
Honey, what are these? 
Is that a handprint?

1431
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,000
No.

1432
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,160
Come on, baby gorgeous.

1433
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,000
We got chores. Come on, let's go.

1434
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:51,010
Ben, are you ready? 
We got groom stuff to do.

1435
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:52,670
Dude, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1436
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:54,060
Man, I hope you scrub from top to bottom,

1437
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,080
'cause who knows what was in that heart rate.

1438
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:57,110
I also showered last night.

1439
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:59,130
Two showers in eight hours?

1440
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:00,850
Go off, King, get clean!

1441
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:16,010
Happy Wedding Day! Are you excited?

1442
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,840
Yes, I'm so excited to marry Claudia.

1443
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,660
But, you know, I'm also hosting a party

1444
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,530
where it feels like we're all 
playing parts in a play,

1445
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:23,970
and I'm not really into the pageantry,

1446
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,730
and I kinda just wanna do a little--

1447
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:28,720
All that matters is that you and Claudia

1448
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:30,580
run for the rest of your lives together.

1449
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,000
I love you.

1450
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,640
I love you too.

1451
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,850
Bae?

1452
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:38,380
Hey, you're still good to 
get the cake, right?

1453
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:39,540
Yes, ma'am.

1454
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:41,000
Awesome. I put Margaret on it with you,

1455
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
just to be safe.

1456
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,000
Margaret.

1457
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:54,090
All right, talk to me, baby.

1458
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:56,360
Who's it gonna be, Margaret or Bae?

1459
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:57,910
Come on, man, don't give me that.

1460
01:14:57,930 --> 01:14:59,660
We're just two girls talking.

1461
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,660
I get it, though. It's tough.

1462
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,000
Magpie's your dream girl.

1463
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:05,020
She's confident, beautiful,

1464
01:15:05,050 --> 01:15:07,500
and she knows how to put out 
a fire with her attire.

1465
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:09,000
Now Bae's waxing her other hand.

1466
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Whoo!

1467
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,070
She's smart, funny, quick,

1468
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:13,970
and she got an ass you could 
bounce a quarter off of.

1469
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,020
- Peter.  - What?

1470
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:17,660
I'm not objectifying Margaret, man.

1471
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,000
That'd be inappropriate. 
That's my cousin.

1472
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,570
It's inappropriate with Bae too.

1473
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,240
This is deeper than I thought.

1474
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:23,880
Hey, Sydney!

1475
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,210
My boy is in love!

1476
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:27,700
- Stop, dude, just stop.  - What?

1477
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,730
I know what you're doing.

1478
01:15:28,750 --> 01:15:30,080
I know what you've all been doing.

1479
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:32,030
You set us up, and we went along with it.

1480
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,060
But it's fake.

1481
01:15:33,370 --> 01:15:34,370
It was my stepdad, right?

1482
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:35,390
He can't act for shit.

1483
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:36,850
You suck too, bro.

1484
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:37,880
That's foul, dog.

1485
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,900
It's definitely gotta be Bae, man.

1486
01:15:39,930 --> 01:15:40,930
I don't know, man.

1487
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:41,950
I don't fucking know.

1488
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:42,980
She doesn't know what she wants.

1489
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
She's single for basically 
the first time in her life.

1490
01:15:46,030 --> 01:15:47,030
She just quit law school.

1491
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:49,050
Her fucking fiancé's here.

1492
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,080
Man, stop with all the white boy--

1493
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,100
- What the--  
- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1494
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:54,130
Seriously.

1495
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,250
Anytime something gets real, you run away,

1496
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,280
call yourself a fuckboy, make an excuse,

1497
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,860
and you just move on to the next.

1498
01:16:00,410 --> 01:16:01,410
It's Bae.

1499
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,520
We jumped off a boat for her.

1500
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:08,490
Oh, that's perfect.

1501
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:09,450
They're gonna love it.

1502
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,480
Thank you so much.

1503
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,740
Let me get this boxed up for you.

1504
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,760
- Thank you.  - Thank you.

1505
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,610
I don't get all the pageantry of weddings.

1506
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,970
If you like someone, give 'em a snog.

1507
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Keep it to yourselves.

1508
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,420
I wore a wedding dress for Halloween

1509
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:22,450
for five years in a row.

1510
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:23,180
Stop it.

1511
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,200
No, I know.

1512
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:25,230
It's so pathetic.

1513
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:27,450
But I am with you now.

1514
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,250
This is not for me.

1515
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,150
So you and Ben aren't serious?

1516
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:32,920
What?

1517
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:34,950
No, no, it's just...

1518
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,520
we're just situationally together.

1519
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:39,910
'Cause when I saw you 
last night in the harbor,

1520
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:41,470
I thought it might be more with you two.

1521
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:44,600
Just...situationally.

1522
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:47,620
- Is that an American thing?  
- I don't even know.

1523
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:50,650
So you're right if I have a go at him, then?

1524
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:53,000
I feel like I might have made 
a mistake letting him loose.

1525
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,560
If that's not okay, just tell me.

1526
01:16:57,590 --> 01:16:58,700
For real.

1527
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,000
I know he really likes you.

1528
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:09,830
How do you think I should 
play this with Ben?

1529
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:12,350
Should I wait until after the wedding?

1530
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:14,280
Um...I don't know.

1531
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,050
Have you guys hooked up?

1532
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
- Hey.  - We're Beatrice.

1533
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,300
You quit school?

1534
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:19,330
You're just gonna pour gasoline 
on everything you've worked for?

1535
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:21,000
Is there still time to re-enroll?

1536
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Soon as you broke up with Jonathan, 
everything turned to pot.

1537
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,780
Are you on drugs? 
Because at least then I'd understand.

1538
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:28,750
Who told you I quit law school? 
Was it Ben?

1539
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:29,780
- You quit school?  - What?

1540
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,000
When were you gonna tell us?

1541
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:32,360
Is this to get back at us?

1542
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,000
I'm sorry if we pushed you to succeed your whole life.

1543
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
We're such awful parents.

1544
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Mom, this isn't about you.

1545
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Yes it is. It is about us.

1546
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
And no, we're not gonna let you 
throw away your life

1547
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
because you're going through something.

1548
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Everyone is always going through something.

1549
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
It's called life.

1550
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Hey.

1551
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,000
I can't believe you.

1552
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:52,620
You told him I quit school?

1553
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,390
No, I didn't.

1554
01:17:53,410 --> 01:17:55,000
You told Pete. Pete told us.

1555
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:56,350
I told you what?

1556
01:17:56,370 --> 01:17:58,940
Yeah, no, I told Pete, b
ut I didn't mean it like that.

1557
01:17:58,960 --> 01:17:59,690
Told me what?

1558
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:01,390
That we're gonna find out at some point.

1559
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:02,900
That's not for you to decide.

1560
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1561
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:05,610
It doesn't matter how we found out.

1562
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:06,380
Found out what?

1563
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,000
She quit law school.

1564
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,000
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

1565
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,220
You're real shit.

1566
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,000
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.

1567
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,280
There's a reason why you're alone. 
No one can trust you.

1568
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,000
Yeah, what's your reason?

1569
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:17,970
Guys like you.

1570
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Keep telling yourself that.

1571
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:21,000
Fuck off.

1572
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
Don't do this right here, right now.

1573
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,500
I messed this all up. It's all on me.

1574
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:27,580
Why don't we all go for a swim, eh?

1575
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:28,950
Cool off before the wedding?

1576
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,710
That's a great idea. 
Maybe early drinks?

1577
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:34,790
Guys, I am so sorry, 
but your plan is all ruined.

1578
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,000
We are not together. 
We were faking it the whole time.

1579
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,630
You knew?

1580
01:18:38,650 --> 01:18:39,860
What are they even talking about?

1581
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:43,040
Well, we may have orchestrated 
a union between the pair of them

1582
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:45,420
in order for peace to prevail across the land.

1583
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:46,510
You lied to us?

1584
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,020
What have you been honest about lately?

1585
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:50,650
So you lied to me too?

1586
01:18:50,890 --> 01:18:52,000
You're not together?

1587
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I could never be with someone like him.

1588
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
Yeah, 'cause I'm the one who fucked it up.

1589
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,350
You did fuck it up.

1590
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,140
I fucked it up?

1591
01:18:58,170 --> 01:18:59,000
Yeah, you fucked it up.

1592
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I fucked it up?

1593
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,000
You fucked it up.

1594
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:02,750
Oh, no.

1595
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,000
Bad dog, Kalonofin.

1596
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I mean, good dog, you killed that shit,

1597
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,740
but next time read the room, Kaymoney.

1598
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I am so sorry.

1599
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,000
Hey, uh...

1600
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,000
Bae.

1601
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,420
I think he's gonna be fine.

1602
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,450
He's gonna be fine.

1603
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:37,000
He's gonna be fine.

1604
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:14,680
Good, you're perfect.

1605
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:41,260
Relax, you're working yourself up.

1606
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,260
It is not fine. It is not everything.

1607
01:20:43,260 --> 01:20:44,610
It is fine.

1608
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,230
Okay, all we asked of them was to come out here,

1609
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,560
celebrate us, and they are ruining it.

1610
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,590
And all week and I have been so stressed,

1611
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:54,230
and you've been more worried 
about what's going on with bae

1612
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:55,260
than with me.

1613
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,260
Well, you've been more 
concerned about your planning.

1614
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:00,050
Are you marrying me or your itinerary?

1615
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,260
Well, if that's how you feel,

1616
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:05,140
then why are we even doing this?

1617
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:08,760
I don't know.

1618
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,040
You tell me.

1619
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:19,700
There's one last thing we need to fake.

1620
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,260
Claudia, Allie, we're assholes.

1621
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,560
We're really sorry.

1622
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:56,510
I'm a terrible sister, 
and he's a terrible friend.

1623
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,540
It's your guys' big day.

1624
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,260
We're not gonna mess it up, we promise.

1625
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:02,590
Uh-huh, but just so you both know,

1626
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:05,260
if you fuck up today, 
the something I borrowed

1627
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:08,260
is a knife, and it's shiny and new.

1628
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:56,260
Love is intoxicating.

1629
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:59,260
It envelops you, it tickles you,

1630
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,260
and it makes you feel 
like you can walk on air.

1631
01:23:02,260 --> 01:23:04,260
It's like this wind.

1632
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,260
It's in your bones, it's in your breath,

1633
01:23:06,260 --> 01:23:08,030
it's in every beat of your heart.

1634
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:10,260
You can't look for it, you can't describe it,

1635
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:12,930
and you can't escape it.

1636
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:16,260
Allie, I love you so much,

1637
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:18,860
and I don't think I say it enough.

1638
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,920
You are the yin to my yang,

1639
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,260
peanut butter to my jelly,

1640
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:25,490
and I will love you forever and always.

1641
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:29,220
Claudia, I love you with so much of my heart

1642
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:32,260
that none is left to protest.

1643
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:33,890
That's very good.

1644
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,910
Just made it up.

1645
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:38,370
A lot of it.

1646
01:23:46,450 --> 01:23:49,140
I now pronounce you married!

1647
01:23:56,450 --> 01:23:57,160
Yeah!

1648
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:28,010
Oh, look, there she is.

1649
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,260
Oh, hey, parents.

1650
01:24:30,260 --> 01:24:32,260
Is that Tasmania?

1651
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,260
Yeah.

1652
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,020
How are you doing, honey?

1653
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:39,040
I am so sorry I lied to 
you guys about school.

1654
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:41,260
I didn't want to disappoint
you guys again.

1655
01:24:41,260 --> 01:24:43,260
Well, if you'd just told us, 
maybe we could have--

1656
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,540
Trying to talk me out of it?

1657
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,560
No, maybe we could have supported you.

1658
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,260
I know this is scary for you guys.

1659
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,740
Yeah, it's scary for me too,

1660
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:54,260
and I gotta figure it out on my own.

1661
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:57,040
I know that every now and then

1662
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:58,260
we might come off as a little...

1663
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,670
Controlling?

1664
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:00,260
No.

1665
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:01,260
Overbearing?

1666
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:01,840
No.

1667
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:02,860
Actually crazy?

1668
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:03,580
Yes.

1669
01:25:03,610 --> 01:25:07,160
That's it, but only because 
we love you so much.

1670
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:10,970
Love you.

1671
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:16,260
Good luck.

1672
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:17,260
Good luck.

1673
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:48,700
Hi, Aunt.

1674
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:49,260
Yes?

1675
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,260
Do you mind if I steal a hand?

1676
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,800
Uh, not at all.

1677
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:52,260
Go ahead.

1678
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:53,610
High five.

1679
01:25:56,170 --> 01:25:56,880
Hey.

1680
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,480
Hi.

1681
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,740
Where's Bo?

1682
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,260
He buggered off.

1683
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:08,260
He said he saw a wave he 
couldn't morally not surf.

1684
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:09,260
I'm sorry.

1685
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,260
It was never really anything.

1686
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:14,260
And you and Bea.

1687
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:18,260
She said you were just situational.

1688
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,260
She said that?

1689
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:33,920
Are you good?

1690
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:37,260
Yeah, we know it's been a 
tough weekend for you.

1691
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:39,260
I don't know.

1692
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,260
These last few days really made me realize

1693
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,260
how much I miss you.

1694
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:48,720
Why don't you just go for a walk?

1695
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:49,260
Figure your head.

1696
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:50,260
Yeah, we'll go with you.

1697
01:26:50,260 --> 01:26:51,260
No, we won't.

1698
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,260
No.

1699
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:54,260
I love you, but this is our wedding.

1700
01:26:54,260 --> 01:26:55,260
So...

1701
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,260
Are you sure?

1702
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:57,260
Yeah.

1703
01:26:57,830 --> 01:27:00,260
I might go and do some people watching.

1704
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,260
Just not...

1705
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,260
these people.

1706
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:08,260
Thank you.

1707
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:19,260
Wow.

1708
01:27:20,860 --> 01:27:21,490
Ben.

1709
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,840
I wanted this for so long.

1710
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:34,260
But I think I'm just holding on to a memory.

1711
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:36,490
And also, I...

1712
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:42,260
I'm sorry.

1713
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:44,260
I'm so sorry.

1714
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:28,630
I've never seen Bea like this before.

1715
01:28:28,660 --> 01:28:29,260
Really?

1716
01:28:30,350 --> 01:28:31,960
You were the one who said 
there's a thin line

1717
01:28:31,980 --> 01:28:33,260
between love and hate.

1718
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,330
You're always the first person 
to say that bit, you know?

1719
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:37,260
I know it sounds crazy,

1720
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:39,260
but even when they were 
yapping at each other,

1721
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:41,260
I've never seen Bea happier.

1722
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:43,260
Same with Ben.

1723
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,260
Hey, stepfather, may I have a word?

1724
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,500
Yes, but make it quick, son.

1725
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:50,310
I promised my lady a dance, 
but don't tell your mother.

1726
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:53,260
You're so clever.

1727
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:55,260
You know who's also clever?

1728
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,260
Ben.

1729
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,260
You know who else would 
be perfect for Ben?

1730
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:01,260
That mumbly girl who always 
looks like she's got a secret.

1731
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:02,260
You know her name is Bea.

1732
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:04,260
That was a callback.

1733
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,830
Will you stop?

1734
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:07,020
Stop.

1735
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:09,690
How you going, mate? How you going, Ben?

1736
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:10,710
What, you two?

1737
01:29:11,290 --> 01:29:12,040
What?

1738
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:15,580
Just enough with the loud 
talking and the overhearing.

1739
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:16,600
Just stop.

1740
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:18,260
Bro, we literally didn't know 
you were standing there.

1741
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,260
Yeah, it's true. 
We didn't know you were listening.

1742
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:20,260
We did.

1743
01:29:20,530 --> 01:29:21,260
It was greatly a performance for one.

1744
01:29:21,260 --> 01:29:22,850
And we nailed it, too.

1745
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:23,880
What is with you people?

1746
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:26,260
This entire weekend, 
I have been lied to

1747
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:28,850
and manipulated and puppeteered.

1748
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,410
I don't know what is real and what is not.

1749
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,260
Mate, I know you're a little blurry,

1750
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:35,260
but I meant what I said up there about love.

1751
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:39,260
It's too precious a resource to be wasted.

1752
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:41,260
I haven't seen her. Is she, uh--

1753
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:43,260
She went on a walk a while ago.

1754
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,260
After she saw you kissing Margaret.

1755
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:48,260
What?

1756
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:49,260
No, I didn't kiss Margaret.

1757
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:51,260
Margaret kissed me. I backed up.

1758
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:52,260
I don't want to be with Margaret.

1759
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,260
I want to--

1760
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,260
Stop it.

1761
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,260
You gorgeous idiot.

1762
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:57,260
Run. Don't wait on love.

1763
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,680
Fight for it.

1764
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,040
And don't worry about the age difference.

1765
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:02,000
I'm 29.

1766
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,100
Honey, no one's 29.

1767
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:06,490
Do you know where she went?

1768
01:30:06,510 --> 01:30:09,160
She said she wanted to walk around, 
do some people watching.

1769
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:10,570
That's what she said?

1770
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:11,530
People watching?

1771
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:14,380
I think it was more of a 
euphemism for crying alone.

1772
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,560
No, it's not.

1773
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:19,830
I think I know where she might be.

1774
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,850
Good God, man, go get her.

1775
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:23,440
Scour the city block by block.

1776
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:24,680
Scan the grid.

1777
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:25,950
First north, south, then east, west.

1778
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:27,340
Leo, I know exactly where she is.

1779
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:29,370
It makes it a lot easier.

1780
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:38,000
I just need to find my moving train.

1781
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,000
What's going on here?

1782
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Is that coffee?

1783
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Yeah.

1784
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Oh, wait.

1785
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,520
Call harbor rescue!

1786
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:56,000
Oh, my God!

1787
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Oh, my God!

1788
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,010
What the hell? Are you crazy?

1789
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Please ask a favor!

1790
01:32:22,910 --> 01:32:25,610
Why don't you just treat people like my folks?

1791
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:27,640
Just go get the girl.

1792
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:29,660
Thank you!

1793
01:32:39,070 --> 01:32:40,800
Excuse me!

1794
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:42,830
Excuse me!

1795
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:57,210
I didn't kiss Margaret. 
She kissed me.

1796
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,240
I know that's a bullshit excuse, 
but it's true.

1797
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,000
I couldn't find a moving train.

1798
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,840
Sorry, it's the best I could do.

1799
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:07,090
Are you out of your mind?

1800
01:33:07,110 --> 01:33:08,000
Yeah.

1801
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Because it's been two years since we met

1802
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
and I haven't spent every 
single day with you.

1803
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
That's the sign of a crazy person.

1804
01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,000
I hated you.

1805
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,660
I didn't really give you a choice.

1806
01:33:17,680 --> 01:33:19,350
I definitely didn't hate you.

1807
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:21,130
You called me a bitch.

1808
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,820
I said you were acting like a bitch.

1809
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:23,850
No, I was a bitch.

1810
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,530
The way I handled everything.

1811
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,730
The way I handled the first night.

1812
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:29,480
The way I handled last night.

1813
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,310
Yeah, it wasn't really awesome.

1814
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:34,760
Why did you leave?

1815
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:37,370
I thought you were going to regret it.

1816
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:40,170
And I couldn't face the idea 
of losing someone else

1817
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,510
that I...

1818
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I really loved.

1819
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,360
Last night was the first thing 
I haven't regretted

1820
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:50,000
in a long time.

1821
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:54,000
I love the way we fight.

1822
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I love how smart you are.

1823
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
I love the weird way you

1824
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
stick your hands down my pants.

1825
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,830
And I love how you know what you don't want.

1826
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:05,210
And if it's not me,

1827
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,650
if I don't

1828
01:34:06,670 --> 01:34:08,000
check all your boxes,

1829
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,500
if I'm not the one,

1830
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:11,220
I get it.

1831
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That would really,

1832
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
really fucking suck.

1833
01:34:21,980 --> 01:34:24,000
So, you gonna kiss me now?

1834
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:28,000
Yeah, I am.

1835
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:44,000
That's a lot of running for Mr. No Cardio.

1836
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Yeah, I'm dying. I need some air.

1837
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:50,690
How do they know my Serenity song?

1838
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,360
I'm sorry you almost called off your wedding

1839
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,920
because of all of our bullshit.

1840
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:22,160
- What?  - What?

1841
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,880
I saw you arguing on the porch.

1842
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,360
Oh, no, no, no, we staged a fake fight

1843
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,360
so you guys would feel bad and make up.

1844
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,640
Are you marrying your 
precious itinerary or me?

1845
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:30,560
Well, if that's how you feel,

1846
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:32,660
I don't know why we're doing this anymore.

1847
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:35,760
Thank you very much.

1848
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:36,600
Puppets.

1849
01:37:37,390 --> 01:37:38,580
We're just puppets.

1850
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:40,420
Yep.
